        The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to provide an exclusive, additional, alternative and complete method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be deemed and construed to be supplemental and additional to, and not in derogation of, powers conferred upon the commission by law; provided, however, that insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the provisions of any general or special law, administrative order or regulation, or law of the municipality, the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no provision of the municipal charter requiring the ratification by the voters of certain bond issues shall apply to the issuance of bonds of the commission pursuant to this chapter or to the guaranty of the municipality or the bonds of the municipality authorized by section nine.
