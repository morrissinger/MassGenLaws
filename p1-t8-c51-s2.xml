        A registered voter who chooses to adopt a new name shall continue to be registered in his former name until June first of the following year at which time the voter shall be registered in his new name; provided, however, that if such voter appears in person prior to the close of registration for any preliminary, primary, or election to notify the registrars of such adoption of a new name, the registrars shall correct the current annual register so that such voter shall be registered in his new name. 
If a voter does not choose to adopt a new name as a result of marriage, the registrars shall make no change in the name of such voter entered in the current annual register.
