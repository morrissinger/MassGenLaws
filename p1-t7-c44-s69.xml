        If a check in payment of a municipal or district service rendered or fee or charge imposed is not duly paid, there may, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, be imposed on the person who tendered such check, upon notice and demand by the city, town or district treasurer, a penalty in the same amount as that imposed under the provisions of section fifty-seven A of chapter sixty. 
Any person upon whom such penalty is imposed may, within sixty days of the imposition of such penalty, appeal in writing to the commissioner who shall abate the same if it is determined that such check was tendered in good faith with reasonable cause to believe that it would be paid.
