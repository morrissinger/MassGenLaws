        The commissioner shall be the executive and administrative head of the department of energy resources and shall be responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of law relative to the division and to each administrative unit thereof. 
There shall be within the department 3 divisions: (i) a division of energy efficiency, which shall work with the department of public utilities regarding energy efficiency programs; (ii) a division of renewable and alternative energy development, which shall oversee and coordinate activities that seek to maximize the installation of renewable and alternative energy generating sources that will provide benefits to ratepayers, advance the production and use of biofuels and other alternative fuels as the division may define by regulation, and administer the renewable portfolio standard and the alternative portfolio standard; and (iii) a division of green communities, which shall serve as the principal point of contact for municipalities and other governmental bodies concerning all matters under the jurisdiction of the department of energy resources. Each division shall be headed by a director who shall be appointed by the commissioner and who shall be a person of skill and experience in the field of energy efficiency, renewable energy or alternative energy, and energy regulation or policy, respectively. The directors shall be the executive and administrative heads of their respective divisions and shall be responsible for administering and enforcing the law relative to such division and to each administrative unit thereof under the supervision, direction and control of the commissioner. The directors shall serve at the pleasure of the commissioner, shall receive such salary as may be determined by law and shall devote full time during business hours to the duties of the office. In the case of an absence or vacancy in the office of the director, or in the case of disability as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner may designate an active director to serve as director until the vacancy is filled or the absence or disability ceases. The acting director shall have all the powers and duties of the director and shall have similar qualifications as the director. 
The commissioner may, from time to time, subject to appropriation, establish within the department such administrative units as may be necessary for the efficient and economical administration of the department and, when necessary for such purpose, may abolish any such administrative unit, or may merge any 2 or more of them, as the commissioner deems advisable. The commissioner shall prepare and keep current a statement of the organization of the department, of the assignment of its functions to its various administrative units, offices and employees, and of the places at which and the methods whereby the public may receive information or make requests. Such statement shall be known as the departmentâ€™s description of organization. A current copy of the description of organization shall be kept on file in the office of the secretary of state and in the office of the secretary of administration.
