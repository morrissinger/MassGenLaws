Of these skills, literacy in the English language is among the most important.

    	     The public schools of Massachusetts have done an inadequate job of educating many immigrant children, requiring that they be placed in native language programs whose failure over past decades is demonstrated by the low English literacy levels of those children.

        <section prefix="f">
    	     Therefore it is resolved that: all children in Massachusetts public schools shall be taught English as rapidly and effectively as possible.
