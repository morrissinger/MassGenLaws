        The department shall establish rules and regulations for the licensing of out-of-hospital dialysis units not operated as a part of a hospital licensed under this chapter. The department shall issue for a term of two years and renew for a like term, a license to maintain an out-of-hospital dialysis unit to any person whom it deems responsible and suitable to establish and maintain such a unit; provided, that said person presents evidence satisfactory to the department that said person has and maintains a written agreement with a hospital licensed under this section which maintains a chronic dialysis unit for supportive services deemed necessary by the department through regulation. Any license so granted shall be deemed an original license. Said licenses shall be subject to suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew for cause, subject to the provisions of this section. The fee for issue or renewal of said license shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven.
