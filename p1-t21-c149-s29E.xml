    	     Every contract for construction shall provide reasonable time periods within which: (i) a person seeking payment under the contract shall submit written applications for periodic progress payments; (ii) the person receiving the application shall approve or reject the application, whether in whole or in part; and (iii) the person approving the application shall pay the amount approved. The time periods for each application for a periodic progress payment shall not exceed: (i) for submission, 30 days, beginning with the end of the first calendar month occurring at least 14 days after the person seeking payment has commenced performance; (ii) for approval or rejection, 15 days after submission; provided, however, that the time period, as applicable to approval or rejection by the person at each tier of contract below the owner of the project, may be extended by 7 days more than the time period applicable to the person at the tier of contract above the person; and (iii) for payment, 45 days after approval, unless the payment is subject to the condition of receipt of payment by a third person but only to the extent enforceable under subsection (e). An application for a periodic progress payment which is neither approved nor rejected within the time period shall be deemed to be approved unless it is rejected before the date payment is due. A rejection of an application for a periodic progress payment, whether in whole or in part, shall be made in writing and shall include an explanation of the factual and contractual basis for the rejection and shall be certified as made in good faith. A rejection of an application for a periodic progress payment shall be subject to the applicable dispute resolution procedure. A provision in the contract which requires a party to delay commencement of the procedure until a date later than 60 days after the rejection shall be void and unenforceable.

The time period shall not exceed 30 days after the later of commencement of the performance of the work on which the request is based or submission of the written request; provided, however, that the time period, as applicable to approval or rejection by the person at each tier of contract below the owner of the project, may be extended by 7 days more than the time period applicable to the person at the tier of contract above the person. A request which is neither approved nor rejected within such time period shall be deemed to be approved and may be submitted for payment within the next application for a periodic progress payment, unless it is rejected before the date payment is due. A rejection of a request, whether in whole or in part, shall be made in writing, shall include an explanation of the factual and contractual basis for the rejection and shall be certified as made in good faith. A rejection of a request shall be subject to the applicable dispute resolution procedure.
