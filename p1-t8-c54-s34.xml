        A city or town may, by vote of a majority of the city council or by vote of a majority of the board of selectmen, at a meeting held at least one hundred and twenty days before the primary, preliminary election or election at which voting machines are to be used, determine upon and purchase, lease, or lease with an option to purchase, one or more voting machines approved as provided in section thirty-two, and order the use thereof at primaries, preliminary elections and elections of state, city or town officers in such city or town; and thereafter at all primaries and elections of state, city or town officers in that city or town, until otherwise ordered by the city council in a city and the selectmen in a town, said machines shall be used at primaries and preliminary elections and for voting for the officers to be elected at such elections and for taking the vote upon questions submitted to the voters. Notice of such determination to use voting machines, or to discontinue the use thereof, shall be sent to the state secretary by the city or town clerk within five days after such determination; provided, however, that no such discontinuance shall take place later than ninety days prior to a state or presidential primary or state election, nor later than thirty days prior to a city or town primary, preliminary election or election at which it is to become effective. 
A city or town may, by vote of a majority of the city council or by vote of a majority of the board of selectmen, at a meeting held not later than one hundred and twenty days prior to a state or presidential primary or state election, and not later than sixty days prior to a municipal primary, preliminary election or election at which an electronic voting system is first to be used, determine upon the use of, and may lease, purchase, or lease with an option to purchase, the marking units or automatic tabulating equipment necessary to any electronic voting system approved for use in the commonwealth in accordance with section thirty-two. Thereafter, at all primaries, preliminary elections and elections held in said city or town, until otherwise ordered by vote of the city council in a city or of the selectmen in a town, said electronic voting system shall be used in those polling places designated by the city council or board of selectmen. 
Notice of determination to use an approved electronic voting system, or to discontinue its use, shall be sent to the state secretary by the city or town clerk within five days after such determination; provided, however, that no such discontinuance shall take place later than ninety days prior to a state or presidential primary or state election, nor later than thirty days prior to a city or town primary, preliminary election or election at which it is to become effective; and, provided further, that no such discontinuance shall prevent the state secretary from selecting appropriate voting machines and vote tally systems pursuant to section thirty-two.
