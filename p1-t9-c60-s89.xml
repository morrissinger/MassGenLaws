        If a person pays his tax within said thirty days, the officer shall receive from him for his fees five per cent on the sum assessed; but if a tax remains unpaid after said thirty days, he shall collect it by distress or imprisonment, or by sale of land as a collector would do. The officer may also levy his fees for service and travel in the collection of each personâ€™s tax, as in other cases of distress and commitment, or sale of land.
