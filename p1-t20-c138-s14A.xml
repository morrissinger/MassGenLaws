        The licensing authority in any city or town wherein the granting of licenses to sell all alcoholic beverages or wines and malt beverages only may grant licenses for the sale of wine at auctions, not to be drunk on the premises, to an applicant that is licensed as an auctioneer pursuant to chapter 100 for not less than 10 years. Each license shall describe the premises to which it applies and shall be granted only for the premises which are either the principal place of business or headquarters of the applicant and legally zoned to allow such sales or which are the premises of a licensee under section 12 or section 15. The fee for the license shall not exceed the minimum fee for holders of licenses under section 14. A holder of a license for the sale of wine at auctions may conduct any such auction on any day and at any time permitted under section 12. Applications shall be granted by the licensing authority according to the local procedure for granting licenses under said section 14. 
A licensee who holds a license under this section may provide, without charge, on-premises sample wine tastings for prospective customers if such wines shall be available for sale at auction on those premises; provided, however, that no single serving of wine shall exceed 1/4 of an ounce; and provided further, that the licensee shall control the dispensing of the wine.
