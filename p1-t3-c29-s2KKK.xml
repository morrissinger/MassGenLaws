For text effective January 1, 2013, see below.]  (a) There shall be established on the books of the commonwealth a separate fund for the counties of Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Norfolk, Plymouth and Nantucket, to be known as the County Registers Technological Fund, for the benefit of the registers of deeds under the control of the governments of those counties. The fund shall consist of the amounts specified in and collected pursuant to section 41 of chapter 36. The state treasurer shall deposit these amounts into the fund, which shall be expended, subject to section 40 of said chapter 36, solely for the purposes of automation, modernization, operation and technological improvements at the registries of deeds. Each such register shall submit a spending plan to the clerks of the house of representatives and senate, who shall refer the plan to the house and senate committees on ways and means and house and senate committees on post audit and oversight. In preparing the plan, the register shall consult with the commonwealth's chief information officer and the state secretary and require that the projects and purchases funded through disbursements in this section shall be consistent with the enterprise information technology strategy, plan information and technology standards adopted by him. All such monies shall be used to purchase information technology systems that are interoperable with other like systems that are used or will be used by all registries. The plan shall include, but not be limited to, the cost and description of all intangible, personal and real property to be purchased or services to be received for the automation, modernization, operation and technological improvements. If the general court takes no final action relative to the plan within 30 days after the date on which the plan is first referred to those committees, the state treasurer shall disburse the funds according to the plan.  (b) In conjunction with the preparation of the commonwealth's comprehensive annual financial report, the comptroller shall prepare and issue an annual report detailing the revenue and expenditure of the fund.
