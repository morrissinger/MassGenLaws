        There shall be an American and Canadian French cultural exchange commission to consist of seven members, all of whom shall be American citizens descended from Canadians of French ancestry and residents of the commonwealth, to be appointed by the governor for terms of seven years. The governor shall designate one of the members as chairman and shall fill vacancies for the unexpired term. The members shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for their expenses actually and necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. Said commission shall establish, maintain and develop cultural ties between French-Canadians and Franco-Americans; foster a special interest in the historical and cultural background of both groups, as well as in the economic, political, social and artistic life of the countries here involved; and shall help establish or promote French language programs in the schools of the commonwealth.
