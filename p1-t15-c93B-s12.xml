        If a manufacturer or distributor renews its franchise agreements periodically, it shall do so as their contractual periods expire on terms equally available to all of its motor vehicle dealers in the commonwealth unless there is good cause to do otherwise. Any notification provided by a manufacturer or distributor to the effect that the market being served by a motor vehicle dealer is not considered viable in the future shall be void and unenforceable.
