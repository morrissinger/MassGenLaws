    <text>
        The commissioner shall have for the collection of taxes all the powers and remedies provided by chapter sixty for the collection of taxes on personal estate by collectors of towns. Any warrant for the collection of a tax may be issued to any deputy collector, sheriff, deputy sheriff or constable, and he shall have authority to proceed thereunder anywhere within the commonwealth. The officer, to whom a warrant for the collection of such a tax is given, shall collect said tax and interest as herein provided, including the charges and fees provided in section fifteen of chapter sixty, and shall pay over such amounts collected to the commissioner. Such officer, other than a deputy collector, may collect and receive for his fees the sum which an officer would be entitled by law to receive upon an execution for a like amount.
