        For the purpose of preventing, mitigating, or alleviating impacts on the resources of the commonwealth and to the health of its citizens from pollutants emitted by fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities serving retail customers in the commonwealth, the department of environmental protection shall, in consultation with the office of the attorney general and the department of telecommunications and energy, promulgate rules and regulations to adopt and implement for fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities uniform generation performance standards of emissions produced per unit of electrical output on a portfolio basis for any pollutant determined by the department of environmental protection to be of concern to public health, and produced in quantity by electric generation facilities. The department of environmental protection shall have said uniform performance standards for at least one pollutant in effect on, but not before, May 1, 2003, unless three or more other northeastern states enact similar standards before that date, in which case the department of environmental protection may adopt such standards prior to May 1, 2003. The department of environmental protection shall issue annually, by March first of each year, an annual report detailing the implementation and compliance of said program, its standards, and its companion rules and regulations.
