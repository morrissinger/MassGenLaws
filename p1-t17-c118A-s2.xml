    <text>
        Effective July first of every year, the level of any state supplementary payment authorized by section one plus the level of federal supplemental security income in effect at such time shall be increased, subject to appropriation, by a percentage amount equal to the percentage rise in the United States Consumer Price Index for January first of that year over the level of said Index for January first of the previous year plus such additional percentage amount as is recommended annually by the department and appropriated by the general court. In determining said additional percentage amount, consideration shall be given to the goal of reaching, within a reasonable time, a total income level equal to or consistent with the current budget at the intermediate level of living for a retired couple established by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the metropolitan Boston area. 
If, on January first of any year, the level of any state supplementary payment, taking into account the federal supplemental security income benefits, is equal to or exceeds the annual budget at the intermediate level of living for a retired couple as most recently established by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the metropolitan Boston area, or, taking into account variances in category, marital status and living arrangements as established by the department, is not inconsistent with said annual budget, the increase granted on July first next following shall be limited to said percentage rise in said Index.
