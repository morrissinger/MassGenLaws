        Any city or town clerk issuing any license under the authority of any provision of this chapter shall, except as otherwise provided by law, charge a municipal processing fee of one dollar, and where applicable retain such fee; provided, however, that such fee shall be in addition to the fee provided under section seventeen of this chapter. Any other person duly authorized by the director to issue licenses at their place of business, provided such persons are duly bonded, may charge a service fee of up to one dollar and fifty cents for the sale of each such license. No person issuing any license under the authority of this chapter shall make a charge for the issuance thereof nor charge any service charge if no fee is required to be paid for the issuance of a license. The director is authorized to enter into agreements for the sale of licenses through other means that shall be subject to a service charge which shall be determined annually by the secretary of administration and finance under the provisions of section three B of chapter seven. The director shall cause to be printed and otherwise published upon its licenses and within its publications a notice of the fees charged pursuant to this section and section seventeen.
