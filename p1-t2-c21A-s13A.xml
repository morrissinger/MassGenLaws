    <text>
        A system inspector of on-site sewage disposal systems, approved by the department of environmental protection, who performs an on-site inspection sewage disposal system under the provisions of the state environmental code, shall not recommend a specific disposal system installer, including himself, to perform any work related to the replacement, repair, alteration or design of said system; provided, however, that all system inspectors shall, at the time of inspection, provide to the property owner a list prepared by the local board of health of local disposal system installers who are approved to perform such work. Each board of health shall prepare and make available a list containing the name, address, and phone number for at least five such installers who request to be included on such list. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit a system inspector from distributing such list on which his own name shall appear; provided, however, that such inspector shall in no way distinguish his name from others on such list. 
A violation of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.
