        Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or of any effective rule, regulation or order of the commissioner made under this chapter or adopted by the former milk control board under any similar provision of earlier law, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, and such fine may be imposed for each day during which such violation shall continue. A violation of any provision of this chapter or of any effective rule, regulation or order so made or adopted may be reported by any person to the commissioner, who shall investigate such complaint and may institute such action at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary to enforce compliance with any provision of this chapter or of any effective rule, regulation or order so made or adopted, and, in addition to any other remedy, may seek relief by injunction, if in the opinion of the commissioner it is necessary to protect the public interest, without being compelled to allege or prove that an adequate remedy at law does not exist.
