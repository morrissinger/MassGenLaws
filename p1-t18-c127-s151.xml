    <text>
        When a prisoner at the expiration of his sentence is in such condition from bodily infirmity or disease as to render his removal from a correctional institution inexpedient, the principal officer of such institution may, with the approval of the physician, authorize his temporary care at said institution, and shall forthwith report to the commissioner all of the circumstances. If it shall appear to the commissioner that such care may be required for a period longer than sixty days, he shall ascertain whether said discharged prisoner is suffering from tuberculosis or from any other disease for which treatment facilities are available in hospitals or sanatoria under the supervision of the department of public health, and in such case he shall notify the commissioner of public health who shall, if he finds that such facilities are available, receive the discharged prisoner; and if no facilities are available in the department of public health, the commissioner of correction shall notify the commissioner of public welfare, who shall receive said discharged prisoner at the Tewksbury hospital.
