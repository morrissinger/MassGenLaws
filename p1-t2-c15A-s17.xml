        The council, subject to appropriation, shall establish a program entitled the “teaching learning corps”. 
The program shall provide school districts choosing to participate, which contain a significant proportion of low-income students or a significant proportion of students deficient in basic skills, as determined by the board of education with college students as instructional aides. Instructional aides shall assist teachers in instructional activities during regular school programs or extended day programs, but shall not replace existing school personnel. Funds provided under this section shall be used first to provide matching funds for work-study college students, and in the case where work-study students are not available, to hire college students not enrolled in work-study programs. The council, in cooperation with the board of education, shall promulgate rules and regulations for said program, including selection criteria for public school sites, cooperative agreements between colleges and public schools, yearly program evaluation procedures, program duration standards, and other rules.
