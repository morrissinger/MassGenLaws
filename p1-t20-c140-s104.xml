        A license under section ninety-six shall not be granted until the applicant has filed with the commissioner a statement on oath, which in the case of a corporation or association may be made by the president or agent thereof in charge of the business, stating the place in the town where the business is to be carried on, the name and the private and business address of the applicant, and in the case of a corporation the state under the laws of which it is organized, and the name and private address of the clerk or secretary and of the agent or other officer having charge of its proposed business, nor until the applicant, unless excused by the commissioner, files with him a power of attorney, appointing a person satisfactory to the commissioner to be his attorney, upon whom all lawful process may be served in any action or proceeding arising under sections ninety-six to one hundred and twelve, inclusive, with the same effect as if served upon the licensee. If any change occurs in the name or address of a licensee or of the clerk, secretary or agent aforesaid of any licensed corporation, or in the place where the licensed business is carried on, or in the membership of any partnership licensed under said sections, a true and full statement of such change, sworn to in the manner required by this section in the case of the original statement, shall forthwith be filed with the commissioner, who may after a hearing revoke the license.
