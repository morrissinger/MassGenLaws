        Money declared by written instrument to be intended for perpetual care, maintenance, improvement or embellishment of any cemetery, or of any lots or plots therein, to an amount not less than two hundred dollars, may be deposited with the state treasurer, who shall receive and receipt for it in the name of the commonwealth. The depositors at the time of making such deposit shall file with him and with the state secretary a copy of such instrument.

Upon the receipt of a deposit for the perpetual care of individual lots or plots in public burial places or cemeteries, the state treasurer shall so inform the clerk of the city or town in which they are located, and said clerk shall record the facts relating to said deposit in the margin of his records of said lots or plots.
