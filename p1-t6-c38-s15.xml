The medical examiner or police department shall, unless such money or property is required as evidence, deliver it to the person entitled to its custody or possession, or, if not claimed within sixty days, to a public administrator. A medical examiner or police officer who fraudulently refuses to deliver such property within ten days after demand or who converts such property to his own use shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years.
