    <text>
        Upon determination by the board of health that the available supply of water for drinking, culinary and other domestic purposes in any place of habitation, or in any place where food or drink is prepared, handled or served to the public, is so unsafe or inadequate as to constitute a nuisance within the meaning of this chapter, said board may issue a written order to the owner of such place, as appearing in the current records of the assessors, requiring him to discontinue the use of the water supply, or, at his option, to provide such place with a water supply safe and adequate for such purposes. Any person who wilfully fails or refuses to comply with such an order shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars, and the board may thereupon cause the removal of the occupants of the place to which the order relates, which shall not again be occupied as a place of habitation or place in which food or drink is prepared, handled or served to the public, without its written permission. The superior court, on a petition in equity brought by said board, shall have jurisdiction by injunction or otherwise to enforce any order issued under this section.
