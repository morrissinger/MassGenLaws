        The board shall furnish without charge to each person to whom a certificate of registration is issued a card or insignia bearing the seal of the board and the signatures of its officers, certifying that the holder thereof is entitled to practice the occupation of barbering in this commonwealth during the calendar year in which it was issued. Such card or insignia shall be posted by the holder in a conspicuous place in front of his working chair where it may be readily seen. The card or insignia held by any person whose certificate of registration has been properly renewed shall be renewed annually without charge on or before the first day of January. If any holder of a certificate of registration fails to apply for a renewal of his card or insignia on or before the first day of January in any year, said certificate of registration may be revoked by the board.
