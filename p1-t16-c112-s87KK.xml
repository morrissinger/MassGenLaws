        Every applicant for registration as a hairdresser, aesthetician, manicurist, instructor, or operator shall receive notice from the board prior to an examination of the time and place of such examination. If the applicant does not appear for any one of three examinations of which he is notified, the examination fee, as provided in section eighty-seven CC, shall be retained by the board, and thereafter such applicant shall register anew as provided in sections eighty-seven T to eighty-seven JJ, inclusive. The notice to such applicant of the third examination shall be by registered mail, postage prepaid, mailed at least seven days prior to the date of examination, addressed to the applicant at his address as appearing on his application, and shall be sufficient service of such notice. If an applicant so requests the board may withhold the sending of notice of the time and place of examination, but if the applicant does not authorize the board to send such notice within a period of two years from the date of filing the application, the examination fee shall be retained by the board, and thereafter the applicant shall register anew as provided in sections eighty-seven T to eighty-seven JJ, inclusive. The provisions of the foregoing sentence shall not be applicable to any person who is in the service of the armed forces of the United States.
