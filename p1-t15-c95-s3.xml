        Each measurer, upon request, shall go to any place within the town for which he is appointed and there ascertain the area of each skin or side or other portion of leather submitted to him. For this purpose, he shall use only such racks, measures or mechanical devices as have been legally tested and sealed, and shall mark or cause each skin or side or other portion of leather to be marked with indelible figures giving the measurement thereof in square feet, including fractions as small as one quarter of a foot. After the area of any skin or side or other portion of leather has been determined as aforesaid, it shall be permissible to add one quarter of a foot to such measurement for any remaining fraction greater than one eighth of a foot; but no such remaining fraction of less than one eighth of a foot shall be added or included in such measurement.
