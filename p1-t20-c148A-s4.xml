        The state fire marshal, commissioner of public safety, the chief administrative justices of the district and housing court departments, respectively, and the president of the Massachusetts Municipal Association board of directors shall jointly prescribe standardized notice of violation forms provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this chapter which shall be uniform throughout the commonwealth. The forms, which may be modified periodically, shall clearly state the procedures, rights and obligations of alleged violators who receive such notices. The commissioner of public safety shall provide such forms to be used by local code enforcement officers to each municipality throughout the commonwealth. The charge for each such form shall be no greater than the actual cost incurred by the commissioner to produce such form.
