All monies which have been appropriated to any department or agency which is included in any consolidation under the provisions of this chapter shall, upon the establishment of the new agency, be credited to the account of such new agency. All contracts in force at the time any new agency is created in which any department or agency whose powers or functions are being assumed by the new agency is a party shall be continued in force by such new agency until they otherwise expire or are cancelled. Any judicial proceeding in which any agency affected by any consolidation under this chapter is a party shall not be affected by the consolidation but any such successor agency shall stand in the place of the former agency.
