        On or about May first of each year, the board shall mail to every architect or architect emeritus registered in the commonwealth a blank application for renewal of certificate of registration. Such blanks properly filled out shall be returned to the board on or before the following first day of August. Each such blank shall be accompanied by a renewal fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. After verification of the facts stated on the renewal blanks, the board shall issue a certificate of annual registration, dated September first, and which shall expire on August thirty-first of the year following. Any holder of a certificate of registration who fails to renew his application within sixty days after notification by the board that his license has expired, shall, before again engaging in the practice of architecture within the commonwealth, be required to register anew, pay a fee as determined under the aforementioned provision and may be required by the board to be re-examined.
