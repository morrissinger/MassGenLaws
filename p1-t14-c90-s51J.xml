        An airport commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the use of municipal airports or for the safety of the public upon or beyond the limits of airports under its control, whether such airport facilities are within or without the territorial limits of the city or town. Such rules and regulations shall not be effective until approved by the Massachusetts aeronautics commission and published in the same manner that by-laws and ordinances are required to be published. Such rules and regulations shall conform to and be consistent with the laws of the commonwealth and the rules and regulations of the Massachusetts aeronautics commission, and shall not be inconsistent with or contrary to any act of the Congress of the United States relating to aeronautics or any regulations promulgated or standards established pursuant thereto.
