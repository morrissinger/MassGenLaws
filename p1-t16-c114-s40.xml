        Appeals shall be tried before a jury, and if the jury find that the tomb, burial ground or cemetery so closed was not a nuisance or injurious to the public health at the time of the order and that the closing thereof was not necessary for the protection of the public health, the court shall rescind such order so far as it affects such tomb, burial ground or cemetery, and the appellant may recover the costs of the appeal from the town where the tomb, burial ground or cemetery was situated. If the order is sustained, the board of health shall recover double costs, to the use of the town.
