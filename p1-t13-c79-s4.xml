        If land of a registered owner, or any right or interest therein, is taken by eminent domain, the board of officers by whom the taking is made shall file for registration in the proper registry district a description of the registered land so taken, giving the name of each owner thereof, referring by number and place of registration in the registration book to each certificate of title, and stating what estate or interest in the land is taken, and for what purpose. A memorandum of the right or interest taken shall be made on each certificate of title by the assistant recorder. If the fee simple of part of the registered land is taken a new certificate shall be entered to the owner for the land remaining to him after such taking. All fees on account of any memorandum of registration or entry of new certificates shall be paid by the body politic or corporate which takes the land. 
If the body politic or corporate which takes the land acquires the fee simple of all or part of the registered land, a new certificate shall be entered to the body politic or corporate making the fee simple taking.
