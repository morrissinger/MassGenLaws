No such registered dentist, person practicing dentistry, or dental hygienist shall include, or permit, or cause to be included, in any newspaper, radio or television advertisement or in any display sign, personal solicitation or other manner of advertising, any written or spoken words or statements of a character that: (1) contains a statement of opinion as to the quality of dental services; (2) refers to benefits or other attributes of dental procedures or products that involve significant risks but that do not include realistic assessments of the safety and efficacy of such procedures or products; (3) contains statistical data, representations, or other information that is not susceptible to reasonable verification by the public; (4) refers to a fee or fees for dental services and fail to disclose that additional fees may be involved in individual cases, if the possibility of incurring such additional fees may be reasonably foreseen; (5) offers a discount for dental services without disclosing the total fee from which the discount will apply; (6) fails to make a disclosure of the source and authorship of any message published under a dentistâ€™s byline; or (7) contain a statement concerning the availability of specialty services to make the public believe that specialty care is rendered in a dental office by a qualified specialist when such is not the case. Nothing in the provisions of this section shall be construed to apply to or prohibit, restrict or limit the operations of the business of a dental laboratory. The board may, by regulation, in a manner consistent with the foregoing, further regulate advertising by persons subject to this section. 
If a registered dentist contracts with a referral service and a fee is required for the registered dentist to be part of the referral service network, the referral service shall disclose the existence of the fee arrangement in any newspaper, radio or television advertisement, or in any display sign, personal solicitation or other manner of advertising. The disclosure shall plainly state the existence of the fee arrangement between the referral service and the dentists belonging to the referral service network and shall further state that only dentists who pay a fee are participants in such service.
