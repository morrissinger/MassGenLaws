        If a deficient fence which has been built up or repaired by a complainant is, after due notice to each party, adjudged sufficient by the fence viewers, and the value of the part of the delinquent occupant, together with the fees of the fence viewers, has been ascertained by a certificate under their hands, the complainant may demand either of the owner or of the occupant of the land where the fence was deficient double the amount so ascertained; and upon the neglect or refusal to pay the same for one month after demand, he may recover the same, with interest at one per cent a month, in an action of contract.
