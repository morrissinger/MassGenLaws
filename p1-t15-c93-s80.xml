No contract for health club services shall require payments or financing by the buyer over a period that extends more than one month beyond the expiration of the contract. The installment payments shall be in substantially equal amounts exclusive of the down payment and shall be required to be made at substantially equal intervals, not more frequently than one payment per month.
