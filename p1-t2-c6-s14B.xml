        The governor shall annually issue a proclamation setting apart the twenty-fifth day of October, the effective date of the state constitution, adopted in seventeen hundred and eighty, as State Constitution Day and recommending that it be observed by the people with appropriate exercises in the schools and elsewhere to the end that the significance of that eventful day may be a constant reminder of the courage and wisdom of our forefathers, who, having won their independence, secured their liberty by establishing on a new foundation a government of law and order, and who did their work so well that said constitution is the oldest written constitution in operation.
