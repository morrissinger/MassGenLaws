    	     Any municipality which creates a decentralized personnel system will be required to establish a local merit appeals board. The board shall consist of three members, of which one member shall be appointed by the local chief executive officer, as defined in section two, to represent management, one member shall be elected by the employees within the community and the third member shall be selected by the other two members. The neutral member shall be an impartial chairman who shall have expertise in personnel administration and labor relations. The members of the board shall serve for three-year terms and shall be reimbursed by the municipality for the necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties; provided, however, that the chairman may be further compensated for services provided to the board. The primary role of the board shall be as an oversight and appellate board on merit principle issues.
