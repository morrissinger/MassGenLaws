Sections one hundred and fourteen to one hundred and nineteen, inclusive, shall apply to all such districts and to all districts which are now subject to the corresponding provisions of earlier laws; but any of said districts may, at the annual meeting or at a meeting called for the purpose at least thirty days before the annual meeting, by a two thirds vote discontinue the use of official ballots, and cease to be subject to said sections.
