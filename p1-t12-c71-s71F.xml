    <text>
        In any city or town which accepts this section, all monies received by the school committee as tuition payments for nonresident students and as state reimbursements for students who are foster care children shall be deposited with the treasurer of the town or city and held as separate accounts. The receipts held in such a separate account may be expended by said school committee without further appropriation for expenses incurred in providing education for such nonresident students or for such students who are foster care children, notwithstanding the provisions of section fifty-three of chapter forty-four. A city or town may appropriate funds for expenses incurred in providing education for such nonresident students or for such students who are foster care children, which funds shall be expended by the school committee in addition to funds provided from other sources.
