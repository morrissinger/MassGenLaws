    	     Any owner, operator or other responsible party reasonably believed to be liable who is aggrieved by any action of the department may petition the department for administrative review of its actions within ten days of receipt of notice as provided in section 5. The departmentâ€™s review and the procedures for reviewing responses made by the department shall not be adjudicatory proceedings and shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 30A or any other law governing adjudicatory proceedings. Any owner, operator or other responsible party aggrieved by the decision of the department may bring a civil action in the nature of certiorari pursuant to section 4 of chapter 249; provided, however, that such action shall be commenced within 30 days of the date of determination on review made by the department.
