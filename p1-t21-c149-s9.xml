        Any person affected by an order, rule or regulation of the department may appeal to the associate commissioners within such time as they by vote may fix, but not less than ten days after notice of the order or the taking effect of the rules or regulations. The associate commissioners shall thereupon give a hearing, and thereafter may amend, suspend or revoke such order, rule or regulation. Pending the hearing the commissioner may suspend the order, rule or regulation appealed from. Any person aggrieved by an order approved by the associate commissioners may appeal to the superior court within fifteen days after the date of approval. The superior court may annul the order if it is found to exceed the authority of the department, and upon petition of the commissioner may enforce all valid orders issued by the department. This section shall not deprive any person of any other lawful remedy.
