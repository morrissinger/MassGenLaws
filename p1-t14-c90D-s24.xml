        Upon the satisfaction of a security interest in a vehicle for which the certificate of title is in the possession of the lienholder, the lienholder shall, within three days after demand and, in any event, within ten days, execute a release of his security interest, in the space provided therefor on the certificate or as the registrar shall prescribe, and mail or deliver the certificate and release to the next lienholder named therein, or, if none, to the owner or any person who delivers to the lienholder an authorization from the owner to receive the certificate. 
Upon the satisfaction of a security interest in a vehicle for which the certificate of title is in the possession of a prior lienholder, the lienholder whose security interest is satisfied shall within three days execute a release in such form as the registrar shall prescribe and deliver the release to the owner, or to any person who delivers to the lienholder an authorization from the owner to receive it. The lienholder in possession of the certificate of title shall either deliver the certificate to the owner, or the person authorized by him for delivery to the registrar, or, upon receipt of the release, mail or deliver it with the certificate to the registrar, who shall release the subordinate lienholder’s rights on the certificate or issue a new certificate. 
If the payment in satisfaction of the security interest is in cash or by certified check, cashier’s check, teller’s check, intra-bank or inter-bank transfer of funds, or an electronic transfer of funds, the payment shall be considered cleared immediately upon receipt by a lienholder.
