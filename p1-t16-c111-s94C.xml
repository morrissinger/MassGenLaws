    	     If the petition is filed by the commissioner of public health or his agent under section ninety-four A in a nonemergency situation, the court shall appoint two physicians experienced in the diagnosis, care and treatment of tuberculosis to examine the person and report to the court on his condition and on his willingness and ability to accept proper medical treatment, and to give their opinion on whether or not it would be a serious danger to the public health to allow the person to be unhospitalized. Neither of these physicians shall be on the full-time staff of a state, county or municipal tuberculosis hospital.
