Upon initial appointment to said board, two members shall continue in office for one year, two members shall continue in office for two years and three members, including the chairperson, shall continue in office for three years. Successors shall be appointed for terms of three years; provided, however, that any person designated to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the board member so replaced.

No two members of said board, while in office, shall be interested in a cosmetology establishment in the same town.
