    <text>
        No ordinance, by-law, rule or regulation of a board of health or the requirements of any public or private institution, school or college shall be enacted, promulgated, or continued in effect which would require a chest x-ray examination to show freedom from tuberculosis in a communicable form, unless the recipient of such x-ray is known to be tuberculin positive. Any report required by such ordinance, by-law, rule or regulation showing freedom from tuberculosis in a communicable form shall be based upon a negative intradermal tuberculin test that is administered and interpreted in a manner approved by the commissioner. In the case of a person whose tuberculin test is positive, a statement by a physician, based upon the results of a standard chest x-ray film shall be required, and such other laboratory and clinical examinations as may be necessary for the exclusion of tuberculosis in a communicable form.
