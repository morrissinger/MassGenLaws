The executive office may reduce MassHealth premiums or copayments, or offer other incentives to encourage enrollees to comply with wellness goals. The executive office shall publish a report annually on: (1) the number of enrollees who meet at least 1 wellness goal; (2) any reduction of copayments or premiums; and (3) any other incentives provided because enrollees met wellness goals. The report shall be submitted to the general court, by filing it with the joint committee on health care financing and the house and senate committees on ways and means.
