        The division, with the advice of the advisory committee, shall investigate alternative revenue sources for early intervention services. A system of payments by families shall be established which promotes accessibility to services to all families in need of such services. This system may include a schedule of sliding fees developed in accordance with applicable state and federal law. 
The division shall develop a donated funds program to encourage the development of funds other than state appropriations for early intervention services. Such sources of funds may include private donations or monies from city, town, or county governments but shall not include funds from other state agencies. The state shall provide two dollars for each dollar of donated funds which have been committed from such non-state source.
