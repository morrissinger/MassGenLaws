        If the insurance on any boiler required by this chapter to be inspected expires, or is cancelled because the insurers deem it unsafe to continue the operation thereof, the owner or user shall cease to operate it until it has been put in a safe condition, satisfactory to the insurers, or has been inspected by the division and a certificate of inspection has been issued.
