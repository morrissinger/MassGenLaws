    <text>
        An apprentice, before starting an apprenticeship, shall file an application with the board, accompanied by the appropriate fee, requesting that an apprentice license be issued. The application shall be made on a form to be furnished by the board and shall require the applicant to state his age, the employerâ€™s name and address and such other information as the board may require. A master sheet metal worker may employ more than 1 apprentices but not more than 1 apprentice may work under the direct supervision of a master or a journeyperson in the employ of the master. The board may, by regulation, establish a maximum length of time for apprentice training. 
Notwithstanding this section, students in a vocational school accredited by the department of education, under the direct personal supervision of a master or journeyperson sheet metal worker who is certified as an instructor by the division of occupational education, may engage in an on-the-job training program on installations approved by the examiners and conducted in cooperation with such a vocational school. The examiners shall adopt rules and regulations relative to the on-the-job training program and may accept such training as fulfillment, in whole or in part, of the necessary prerequisites for journeyperson licensure.
