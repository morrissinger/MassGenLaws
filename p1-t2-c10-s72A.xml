The commissioner shall assign investigators and employees of the unit to the bureau, who shall report to the director of the bureau and to the commissioner; provided, however, that the Massachusetts gaming commission shall designate the number of investigators and employees necessary to staff the unit; and provided further, that the code of ethics established pursuant to subsection (m) of section 3 of chapter 23K shall apply to all investigators and employees of the unit.
