        Cities, towns and districts that have duly authorized the issuance of serial bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness may make expenditures for the purposes for which such serial bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness were authorized from any available revenue funds in advance and in anticipation of such issuance. Cities, towns and districts that have been allotted a grant by the commonwealth or the federal government may make expenditures for the purposes of such grant from any available revenue funds in advance and in anticipation of receipt of reimbursements from such grant, to such maximum amount and subject to such limitations as may be provided in the rules, regulations and guidelines promulgated by the director. For purposes of this section, available revenue funds shall not include revenue cash the use of which is restricted to purposes other than current maintenance expenses. Such advances shall be made by the treasurer with the approval of the officer or officers authorized to issue the bonds or notes. Prior to making any such advance, the treasurer shall determine that the issuance of such serial bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness has been duly authorized in accordance with law. Such cities, towns or districts shall reimburse the account or accounts from which the advance was made from the proceeds of bonds, notes, including notes in anticipation of the serial loan, or certificates of indebtedness issued during the fiscal year in which the advance was made. Advances made under authority of this section shall be subject to rules, regulations or guidelines promulgated by the director.
