        It shall be the duty of any person who discovers unmarked human skeletal remains or who knowingly causes human remains to be disturbed through construction or agricultural activity, to immediately notify the office. The office shall conduct an inquiry to determine whether the remains are suspected of being 100 years old or more, and, if so determined, shall immediately notify the state archaeologist. The state archaeologist shall determine if the skeletal remains are Native American. If the remains are deemed likely to be Native American, the state archaeologist shall immediately notify the commission on Indian affairs which shall cause a site evaluation to be made to determine if the place where the remains were found is a Native American burial site.
