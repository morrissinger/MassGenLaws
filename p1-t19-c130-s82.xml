        No wholesale or retail dealer in shellfish, and no person holding a victuallerâ€™s license, shall receive any shellfish unless the same bears a label or tag legibly marked with the source of supply, the date when taken, and either the certificate or permit number or the name and address of the producer or shipper, and all shellfish in transit shall bear such label or tag so marked. If such shellfish have been processed at a shellfish purification plant operated under the provisions of section seventy-six, the label or tag shall be so marked, and shall contain such other information as the director may by rule or regulation require. He shall for sixty days after receipt of such shellfish keep in his place of business a record of the markings on such tag or label, which record shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any representative of the division or of the department of public health. Whoever violates any provision of this section or fails or neglects to furnish the required label or tag or furnishes such a label or tag bearing false or misleading information or counterfeits, alters, defaces, or tampers with any label or tag shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than ten thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.
