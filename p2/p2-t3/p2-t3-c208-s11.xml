        The evidence produced at such ex parte hearing shall not be reported or made a part of the record in the case and the motion for said amendment shall not be read in open court during the proceedings, but the register of probate shall make an entry in the docket of “Motion to insert name of third person allowed” or “Motion to insert name of third person denied”, as the case may be. If the amendment is allowed upon affidavits, they shall be retained in the court and placed in the custody of the register, and shall be open for the purposes of inspection, and taking copies thereof, to counsel of record, the parties or the third person named in the amendment.
