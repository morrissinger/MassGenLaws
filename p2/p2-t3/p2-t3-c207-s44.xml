        A city by ordinance and a town by vote may authorize its clerk or registrar to pay on demand, in his office, twenty-five cents to any person who has legally solemnized a marriage in the commonwealth, after the receipt by such clerk or registrar of the certificate in legal form of the solemnization of such marriage. A city or town which passes such ordinance or vote shall annually appropriate the money necessary therefor, and the clerk or registrar thereof shall file quarterly with the treasurer or other proper financial officer of said city or town proper vouchers for all such payments.
