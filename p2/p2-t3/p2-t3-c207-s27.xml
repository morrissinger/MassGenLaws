        A party to an intended marriage who has been legally adopted shall, in the notice of intention thereof, give the names of his parents by adoption; and the names of his parents may also be added. The consent of a parent by adoption to the marriage of a minor shall be sufficient if the consent of a parent of a minor is required by law as a preliminary to marriage. If the natural parents of a minor have been divorced and the consent of one of them is required by law, preliminary to the marriage of such minor, the consent of the parent having the custody of such minor shall be sufficient.
