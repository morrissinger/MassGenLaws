        If, after a hearing, the allegations of an action for divorce are not sustained, the court may, if the facts warrant, enter a judgment denying the divorce and making a finding that the plaintiff is living apart from the defendant for justifiable cause, and may make such order relative to the support of either spouse and the care, custody of and maintenance of the minor children of the parties as the circumstances require. The various provisions of chapter two hundred and nine which relate to proceedings commenced under section thirty-two thereof shall be applicable to this section.
