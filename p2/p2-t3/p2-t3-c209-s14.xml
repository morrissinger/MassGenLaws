        If the guardian or conservator of a married man is licensed to sell real estate of his ward, the wife of the ward may join with the guardian or conservator in the conveyance, and release homestead in the granted property, in like manner as she might have done by joining in a conveyance thereof made by her husband if he had been under no legal disability.
