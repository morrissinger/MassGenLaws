        If a foreclosing owner disagrees with the amount of rent or use and occupancy rates that a tenant-at-will or lessee pays to the foreclosing owner, the foreclosing owner may bring a claim in district or superior court or the housing court to claim that the rent is unreasonable and set a new use and occupancy rate. A bona fide lease between the foreclosed-upon owner and the lessee or proof of rental payment to the foreclosed-upon owner shall be presumed reasonable.
