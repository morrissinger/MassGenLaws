        The recorder and all assistant recorders shall be sworn before the chief justice of the land court, and a record thereof shall be made. They shall give bond in a sum to be fixed by the court, for the faithful performance of their official duties, before entering upon the same. They may administer oaths to persons appearing before them in matters pertaining to the registration of land, if an oath is required. They shall keep accurate accounts of all money received as fees or otherwise, which shall be subject to examination by the director of accounts, in the same manner as accounts of registers of deeds. The recorder shall pay over quarterly to the state treasurer all such money received by him either directly or through the assistant recorders, except that money so received for the cost of publication of notices and for the payment of services and expenses of sheriffs and deputy sheriffs shall be disbursed directly by the record. In case of the absence of an assistant recorder, the assistant register for the district, or if there is no assistant register, the person acting as clerk in the office of the register of deeds, shall perform the duties of the assistant recorder, who shall be responsible for him.
