        When the time has expired for redemption after registered land has been set off or sold on execution, or taken or sold for the enforcement of a lien of any description, the person claiming under an execution or a deed or other instrument made in the course of proceedings to levy such execution or enforce any lien may petition for the entry of a new certificate to him, which may be granted. Every such new certificate shall contain a memorandum of the nature of the proceeding on which it is based. Before the entry of a new certificate, the registered owner may pursue all legal and equitable remedies to impeach or annul proceedings under executions or to enforce liens of any description.
