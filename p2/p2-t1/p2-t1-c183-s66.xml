For purposes of this section, a bank, lending institution, mortgage company or mortgagee shall include, but not be limited to, any bank as defined in section one of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven, any national bank, national banking association, federal savings bank, federal savings and loan association and federal credit union. The terms “replacement cost”, “buildings” or “appurtenances” as used in this section shall be consistent in meaning with such terms as used in policy forms approved by the commissioner of insurance.
