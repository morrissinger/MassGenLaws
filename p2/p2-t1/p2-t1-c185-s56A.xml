        Complaints for the confirmation of title without registration and all proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter applicable to complaints and proceedings for the confirmation and registration of title except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Upon the recording in the registry of deeds for the district where the land, or any portion thereof, lies, of a copy of the judgment issued pursuant to such complaint for confirmation of title without registration, the owner of such land, as determined by such judgment, shall hold the title thereto free from all encumbrances except those set forth or referred to in said judgment and those specified in section forty-six. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be so construed as to prevent the registration of title to land or easements or rights under the provisions thereof on proceedings commenced either prior or subsequent to a judgment confirming title without registration.
