        In a limitation of real or personal property by deed, will or other instrument in writing, executed after April thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, the words “die without issue”, or “die without leaving issue”, or “have no issue”, or “die without heirs of the body”, or other words importing either a want or failure of issue of any person in his lifetime or at the time of his death, or an indefinite failure of his issue, shall, unless a contrary intention clearly appears by the instrument creating such limitation, mean a want or failure of issue in the lifetime or at the time of the death of such person, and not an indefinite failure of his issue.
