        In all cases of registration procured by fraud, the owner may pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud, without prejudice however to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title. After the transcription of the judgement of registration on the original complaint, any subsequent registration procured by the presentation of a forged deed or other instrument shall be null and void.
