        Without regard to whether a borrower is acting individually or on behalf of others similarly situated, any provision of a high cost home mortgage loan that allows a party to require a borrower to assert any claim or defense in a forum that is less convenient, more costly, or more dilatory for the resolution of a dispute than a judicial forum established in the commonwealth where the borrower may otherwise properly bring a claim or defense or limits in any way any claim or defense the borrower may have is unconscionable and void.
