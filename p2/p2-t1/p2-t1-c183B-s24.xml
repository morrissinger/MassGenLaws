        Except to the extent otherwise provided by the time-share instrument, the managing entity shall be responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of the time-share units and any personal property available for use by time-share owners in conjunction therewith, other than personal property separately owned by a time-share owner. Each time-share owner shall afford access to his time-share unit reasonably necessary for said purposes, but if damage is inflicted on a time-share unit to which access is taken, the managing entity shall be responsible for its prompt repair. Subject to the provisions of the time-share instrument and other provisions of law, a time-share owner shall not alter or change the appearance of a time-share unit without the consent of the managing entity.
