        Any mortgage note secured by a first lien or second or subsequent lien on a dwelling house of 4 or less separate households or on a residential condominium unit occupied or to be occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor shall be subject to the condition that if said note is paid before the date fixed for payment, any additional amount required to be paid in that event shall be an amount which shall be the balance of the first year’s interest or 3 months’ interest whichever is less; except, that if anticipatory payment is made within 36 months from the date of the note for the purpose of refinancing such loan in another financial institution, an additional payment not in excess of 3 months’ interest may be required; provided, however, that, with respect to the mortgage loan insured by the Federal Housing Commissioner, the mortgagor may be required to reimburse the mortgagee to the full amount of any charges, premiums, or fees required by any statute or by any regulation of the Federal Housing Administration to be paid by the mortgagee upon payment of the note before the date fixed for payment. 
No prepayment fee or additional penalty shall be payable by a mortgagor if the mortgage note is paid in full after 36 months from the date of the note. A mortgagor shall not be required to pay a prepayment fee or penalty for making additional payments toward the principal balance for the term of the loan.
