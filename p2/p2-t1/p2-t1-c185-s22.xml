The recorder shall cause copies of said papers to be made and transmitted to the said register of deeds, who shall file the same, and, if the original papers were filed with the recorder, index the proceedings as above provided. Whenever such papers contain a reference to any instruments recorded in the registry of deeds where they are filed, the register of deeds shall cause a minute thereof to be made upon the margin of such record.
