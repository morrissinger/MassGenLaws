    	     A judicial proceeding for breach of any obligation arising under section forty-five or forty-six shall be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues, but the parties may agree to reduce the period of limitation to not less than two years. With respect to a time-share unit that may be used as a dwelling or for recreational purposes, an agreement to reduce the period of limitation shall be evidenced by a separate instrument executed by the purchaser.

        <section prefix="c">
    	     If a warranty of quality explicitly extends to future performance or duration of any improvement or component of the property, the cause of action accrues at the time the breach is discovered or at the end of the period for which the warranty explicitly extends, whichever first occurs.
