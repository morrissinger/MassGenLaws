        An owner desiring to convey his registered land or any portion thereof in fee shall execute a deed of conveyance, which the grantor or grantee may present to the assistant recorder in the district where the land lies. The assistant recorder shall thereupon, in accordance with the rules and instructions of the court, make out in the registration book a new certificate of title to the grantee. The assistant recorder shall note upon the new certificate the date of transfer, the volume and page of the registration book in which the new certificate is registered and a reference by number to the last preceding certificate. The last preceding certificate and any owner’s duplicate certificate which is surrendered by the grantor, shall be stamped “canceled”. The deed of conveyance shall be filed and endorsed with the number and place of registration of the new certificate of title of the land conveyed.
