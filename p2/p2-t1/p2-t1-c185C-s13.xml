        The clerk, any temporary clerk and every assistant clerk, before entering upon performance of his official duties, and thereafter, at intervals of not more than one year, so long as he continues to hold such office shall give to the commonwealth a bond, conditioned to perform faithfully his official duties, with a surety company, authorized to transact business in the commonwealth as surety, in a sum approved by the chief justice of the housing court department, but in no event less than five thousand dollars. Failure to give such bond shall be sufficient cause for his removal.
