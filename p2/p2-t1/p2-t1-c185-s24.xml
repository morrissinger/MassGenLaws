        The court may refer any such proceeding to one of the examiners appointed under section twelve, who shall examine and report on whatever matters of title or fact the court shall designate in its order of reference. Such reference, if made immediately upon the filing or entry of the proceeding, shall be subject to section thirty-seven, so far as applicable, but if made after an appearance is entered for a defendant or tenant, it shall be subject to section forty-three.
