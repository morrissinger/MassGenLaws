        If an execution or writ of seisin has been issued in an action under chapter two hundred and thirty-seven affecting registered land and served by the officer, he shall cause an attested copy of the execution, with a return of his doings thereon, to be filed and registered within three months after the service and before the return of the execution into the clerkâ€™s office, and the plaintiff, if the judgment was that he was entitled to an estate in fee simple in the demanded premises, or in any part thereof, and for which execution issued, shall thereupon be entitled to the entry of a new certificate of title; but in actions under chapter two hundred and forty-five the commonwealth shall be entitled to have the certificate of the registered owner cancelled by the land court as soon as judgment is rendered in its favor.
