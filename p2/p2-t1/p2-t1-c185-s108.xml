        Actions of contract for compensation under this chapter by reason of any loss or damage or deprivation of land or any estate or interest therein shall be begun within six years after the cause of action accrued; but the plaintiff in an action for the recovery of the land or estate or interest therein in accordance with section one hundred and two may bring the action of contract for compensation within one year after the termination of such action. Said action of contract shall survive to the personal representative of the registered owner, unless barred in his lifetime; but the proceeds thereof shall be treated as real estate.
