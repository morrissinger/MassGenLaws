        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 4. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  (a) Except as extended by paragraph (b), this chapter applies to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment that is created on or after the effective date of this chapter. For purposes of this section, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise becomes irrevocable.  (b) If a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment was created before the effective date of this chapter and is determined in a judicial proceeding, commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter, to violate the commonwealth's rule against perpetuities as that rule existed before the effective date of this chapter, a court upon the petition of an interested person may reform the disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor's manifested plan of distribution and is within the limits of the rule against perpetuities applicable when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment was created.
