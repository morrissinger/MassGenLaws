        When a conveyance or devise of real estate is made to a grantee or devisee to a use intended to be executed by the statute of uses, the word “use” shall be employed in declaring the use; and provisions introduced by the words “in trust”, or other expressions that might otherwise create uses, shall be deemed to create trusts and not uses. If no use is declared in a conveyance or devise of real estate, the same shall take effect as if it were expressed to be for the use of the grantee or devisee.
