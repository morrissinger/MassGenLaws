    	     In addition to any other requirements under this section or section 54C, if the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder elects to provide the discharge to the person transmitting the payoff and that person is someone other than a closing attorney or settlement agent, the discharge shall be accompanied by a transmittal letter that contains a statement in substantially the following form, in not less than 10-point boldface type:

    	     In addition to containing the mortgage reference information required in subsection (b) of section 54, such discharge shall be executed and acknowledged by the holder of the mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby or an authorized person or entity acting on behalf of the holder. If the holder is not the holder of record, the holder shall also specify by what means the holder became the holder of such mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby, and shall: (1) specify the recording information for the documentation on record in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded supporting the holder’s status as such; or (2) record the documentation, along with the discharge, if the holder records the discharge; or (3) provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the holder’s status of record, such documentation shall include, but not be limited to: the note, any assignments, certificates of change of name or certificates of merger; provided, however, that, if the holder’s status as such is based upon a corporate change of name or identity by any of the actions or events described in subsection (i) and the discharge refers to those actions or events as provided in said subsection (i), then the holder need not provide or record any further documentation in support of such actions or events. If the discharge is executed on behalf of a mortgage and note holder by a mortgage servicer, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney or other agent, the mortgage servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent shall, in addition to the information and documents required of the mortgage and note holder, provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the authority of the agent of the mortgage and note holder to act on behalf thereof, or the recording information for the documentation if already recorded in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded. Such documentation shall include, but not be limited to the servicing agreement, power of attorney or other written authorization from the mortgage and note holder to so act on behalf thereof. Any mortgage and note holder, servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent for the mortgage and note holder who provides to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the documentation, rather than recording the same and providing the recording information to such person, shall also forward to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person all recording fees established under sections 38 or 39 of chapter 262 necessary to record the documents.

In such case the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who reasonably demonstrates compliance with this paragraph shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for providing the confirmatory discharge and any required supporting documentation and shall not be responsible for any recording fees therefor.

The mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who fails to comply with this subsection shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of the amount of fees charged to or withheld from the mortgagor and not refunded or credited, with interest thereon, plus $2,500, or the mortgagor’s actual damages, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law.
