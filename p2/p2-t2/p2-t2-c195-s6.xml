        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 14. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Every inventory required to be filed in the probate court shall include an appraisal of the property comprised therein made under the penalties of perjury by the executor or other fiduciary filing the same, setting forth the actual market values of the various items thereof ascertained by such fiduciary to the best of his knowledge, information and belief. Said executor or other fiduciary shall receive no compensation for such appraisal. Before the filing of the inventory upon motion made by the executor or other fiduciary, or after the filing of the inventory upon motion made by any interested person and after such notice as the court may order and after hearing upon such motion, the court may appoint one or more special appraisers of such property or of any item or items thereof, if it shall find such appointment to be in the best interests of the estate. Such appraisers shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duties and shall file their appraisal in the court within three months of their appointment. The values shown in any such special appraisal shall constitute the appraised value of the item or items involved.
