        A person who relies on a caregiver authorization affidavit that is consistent with the requirements of this chapter has no obligation to make any further inquiry or investigation and shall not incur any criminal or civil liability or be subject to professional discipline for doing so, unless he knows facts contrary to the affidavit or knows that an authorizing party has made a decision to supersede the caregiverâ€™s decision. Nothing in this chapter shall relieve a person from liability arising from other provisions of the law.
