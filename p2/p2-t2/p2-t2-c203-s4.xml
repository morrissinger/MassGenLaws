        If a testator has omitted in his will to appoint a trustee in this commonwealth and such appointment is necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the will, the probate court may, after notice to all persons interested, appoint a trustee who shall have the same powers, rights and duties and the same title to the estate as if originally appointed by the testator.
