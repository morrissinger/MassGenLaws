        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 19. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Upon the entry of the appeal, the supposed creditor shall file a written statement of his claim, setting forth briefly and distinctly all the material facts necessary in a declaration for the same cause of action; and like proceedings shall thereupon be had in the pleadings, trial and determination of the cause as in an action at law; but no execution shall be awarded against the executor or administrator for a debt found due to the claimant. The final judgment shall be conclusive, and the list of debts allowed shall be altered by the probate court, if necessary, to conform thereto.
