        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 19. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If it is not ascertained at the end of nine months after the granting of letters testamentary or of administration whether an estate represented as insolvent is or is not so in fact, any creditor whose claim has not been presented for proof may commence an action therefor against the executor or administrator, and such action may be continued without costs for the defendant until it appears whether the estate is insolvent; and if it is not insolvent, the plaintiff may prosecute the action as if no such representation had been made.
