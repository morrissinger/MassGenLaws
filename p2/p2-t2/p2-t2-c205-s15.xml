        A surety on a probate bond may, upon the petition of the surety or of the principal to the supreme judicial court or the probate court, be discharged from all further responsibility, if the court, after notice to all persons interested, finds such discharge reasonable and proper; and the principal shall thereupon give a new bond with such surety or sureties as the court orders.
