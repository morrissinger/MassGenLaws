        In case of the marriage of a woman who is an executrix, administratrix, guardian, conservator or trustee, her sureties shall, upon petition to the probate court in which her bond is filed, be released from further liability thereon, beyond accounting for and paying over the money and property already in her hands by virtue of such trust; and if her sureties are so released, she shall be required to furnish a new bond to the satisfaction of said court, or shall be removed from said trust.
