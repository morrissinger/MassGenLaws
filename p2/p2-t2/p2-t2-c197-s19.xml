        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  A legatee may recover his legacy and enforce all rights in respect to the same by proceedings in equity in the probate court in which the will was proved. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the time within which such proceedings may be brought except that the real estate of the testator shall not be liable to be sold for the payment of a legacy by the executor or other representative of the estate either under a power in the will or under license or order of court in, or as a result of, such a proceeding unless it is filed in the probate court within six years from the testator's death. No action at law shall be brought against the estate of the testator for such recovery.
