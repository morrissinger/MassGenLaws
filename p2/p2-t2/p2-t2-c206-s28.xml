        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 38. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  The probate court may, on petition of any person interested and after public notice, order all money or the proceeds thereof which have been deposited or invested by its authority and which shall have remained unclaimed for twenty years from the date of such deposit or investment to be paid to the residuary legatee, if any, of the testator to whose estate the money belonged, or, if such residuary legatee is dead, to his heirs living at the time of such distribution; and if no such residuary legatee or any of his heirs are then living, or if the deceased died intestate, said money and the proceeds thereof shall be disposed of and distributed among the persons entitled thereto and in the manner provided by chapter one hundred and ninety. The court shall first require from the persons to whom such money shall be ordered paid a sufficient bond of indemnity, with two sufficient sureties to be approved by it, conditioned to repay to the persons for whose benefit such deposit or investment was originally made, or to the personal representatives of such persons, all money paid over by the order of the court under this section.
