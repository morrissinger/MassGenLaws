See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If such advancement is made in real property, the value thereof shall be considered as part of the real property to be divided; if it is in personal property, it shall be considered as part of the personal property; and if in either case it exceeds the share of real or personal property, respectively, which would have come to the heir so advanced, he shall not restore any part of it, but shall receive so much less out of the other part of the estate as will make his whole share equal to the shares of the other heirs who are in the same degree with him.
