        Property in the possession of a museum for which the museum does not know, and has no reasonable means of determining, the identity of the lender or claimant shall become the property of the museum if no person has claimed the property within 7 years after the museum can document the museumâ€™s possession of the property. The museum shall become the owner of the property free from all claims on the day after the 7-year period ends. This section shall not apply to stolen or confiscated property.
