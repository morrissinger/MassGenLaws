        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 10. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If a person claiming to be interested in the estate of a person deceased makes complaint on oath to a probate court against any one suspected of retaining, concealing, or conspiring with others to retain or conceal, a will or testamentary instrument of the deceased, the court may cite the suspected person to appear before it and be examined on oath upon the matter of the complaint. Upon such examination all interrogatories and answers shall be in writing, signed by the person examined, and shall be filed in the court. If the person cited refuses to appear and to answer such interrogatories as are lawfully propounded to him, or to obey any lawful order of the court, he may be committed to jail by warrant of the court until he submits to its order. The court may award costs to be paid by either party, and may issue execution therefor.
