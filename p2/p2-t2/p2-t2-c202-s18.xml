        If an executor or administrator is licensed to sell land which has been fraudulently conveyed by the deceased or is fraudulently held by another person for him, or land to which the deceased had a right of entry or of action or of which he had a right to a conveyance, he may, within one year after such license, sell the land without first obtaining possession thereof by entry or action, or he may without a formal entry bring an action to obtain possession by virtue of such license, demanding the land as executor or administrator, and may sell the same within one year after possession is obtained.
