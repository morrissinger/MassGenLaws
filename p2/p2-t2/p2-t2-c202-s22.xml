        To obtain such license, the guardian or conservator shall file a petition setting forth the condition of the estate and the facts and circumstances on which the petition is founded. If after an examination, on the oath of the petitioner or otherwise, the court finds that it would be for the benefit of the ward that the sale should be made, it may grant a license therefor, specifying therein whether the sale is to be made for the maintenance of the ward and his family, or in order that the proceeds may be placed on interest or invested as aforesaid.
