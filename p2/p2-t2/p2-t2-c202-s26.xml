        If the sale is made by a person other than the guardian, the proceeds shall forthwith be paid to the guardian upon his giving to the judge of probate a bond with sufficient sureties conditioned to account for such proceeds. If there is no guardian, the proceeds shall be placed on interest or invested by the person authorized to sell the property, in like manner as is required of a guardian.
