        A person authorized to sell land under license of court shall be required, upon petition to the probate court by an heir, creditor, ward or other person interested in the estate, to answer on oath as to all matters relative to his exercise and fulfilment of said license as fully as he is liable to account and be examined relative to personal property. If, in relation to the exercise of such license or to a sale under it, there is any neglect or misconduct in the proceedings of such person by which a person interested in the estate suffers damage, such interested person may recover compensation therefor on the probate bond or otherwise as the case may require.
