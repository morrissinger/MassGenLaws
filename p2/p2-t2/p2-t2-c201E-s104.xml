        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 24. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this chapter or a similar law of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity's principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this chapter or a similar law of the state listed as the owner's address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this chapter or similar law is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.
