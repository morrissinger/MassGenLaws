        If a creditor has been preferred, and afterwards in good faith gives the debtor further credit without security of any kind for property which becomes a part of the debtorâ€™s estate, the amount of such new credit remaining unpaid at the time of his decease may be set off against the amount which would otherwise be recoverable from him.
