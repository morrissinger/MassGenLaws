        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If an executor or administrator shall not within six months after the date of death of the deceased have had notice of demands against the estate of the deceased sufficient to warrant him to represent such estate to be insolvent, he may, after the expiration of said six months, pay the debts due from the estate and shall not be personally liable to any creditor in consequence for such payments made before notice of such creditor's demand; and if such executor or administrator shall be in doubt as to the validity of any debt which, if valid, he would have a right to pay under this section, he may, with the approval of the probate court, after notice to all persons interested, pay such debt or so much thereof as the court may authorize.
