        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 10. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If a testator devises land of which he is not seized, but in which he has a right of entry, or if, after making a will, he is disseized of land devised thereby, such land shall nevertheless pass to the devisee in like manner as it would have descended to the testator's heirs if he had died intestate, and the devisee shall have the same remedy for the recovery of such land as such heirs might have had.
