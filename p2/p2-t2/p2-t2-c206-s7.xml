        No final account or discharge of a guardian of a person with an intellectual disability shall be allowed unless at least seven days’ notice has been given to the department of developmental services in the case of a person with an intellectual disability. No account of a guardian of a mentally ill person or a person with an intellectual disability or of a conservator shall be allowed without such notice as the court may order to the United States veterans’ bureau or its successor if the ward is entitled to any benefit, estate or income paid or payable by or through said bureau or its successor.
