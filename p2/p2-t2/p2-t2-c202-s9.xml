        If a will contains a provision for the payment of debts, or which may require or induce the court to marshal the assets in a manner different from that which the law would otherwise provide, the executor shall set forth in the petition a copy of the will, and the court shall marshal the assets accordingly, so far as can be done consistently with the rights of the creditors.
