        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If a debt claimed by an executor or administrator as due to him from the deceased is disputed by any person interested in the estate, the claimant shall file in the probate court a statement of his claim in writing, setting forth distinctly and fully the nature and grounds thereof; and the same may then be submitted under an order of the court to one or more arbitrators, if the claimant and the party objecting agree upon the arbitrators to be appointed. The court shall have the powers of courts of common law to discharge the rule by which the claim is referred, to reject and disallow the award or to recommit it to the arbitrators. The award of such arbitrators, if accepted by the probate court, shall be final and conclusive. The said arbitrators shall be awarded reasonable compensation by the probate court, which shall be paid by the commonwealth.
