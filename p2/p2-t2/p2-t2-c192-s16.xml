See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If all of the persons appointed executors or administrators with the will annexed are the same persons as the temporary executors or temporary administrators with the will annexed, they may account for their administration as temporary executors or temporary administrators with the will annexed in their accounts as executors or administrators with the will annexed, and in such case no new inventory need be filed by such executors or administrators with the will annexed.
