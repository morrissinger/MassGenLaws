        In every action on a bond under sections twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two, the writ shall be endorsed by the persons for whose benefit or at whose request the action is brought or by their attorney, and the endorsers shall be liable for the costs of suit, and execution therefor shall be issued against them and not against the judge. If the action is brought for the benefit of creditors or next of kin, there shall be a further endorsement on the writ specifying that it is brought for the benefit of such creditors or next of kin.
