        If an act or proceeding of a person acting as executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, trustee, receiver, commissioner or in any other fiduciary capacity under an appointment or license of a probate court is void or voidable by reason of an irregularity or of want of jurisdiction or authority in the court which made the appointment or granted the license, any person interested in or affected by such act or proceeding may have the matter heard and determined by the supreme judicial court in equity, which may confirm or set aside, in whole or in part, the act or proceeding.
