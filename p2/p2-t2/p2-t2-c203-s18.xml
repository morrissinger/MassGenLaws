See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If a person who is seized or possessed of real or personal property or of an interest therein upon a trust, express or implied, is a minor, incapacitated by reason of mental illness, out of the commonwealth or not amenable to the process of any court therein having equity powers, and if in the opinion of the supreme judicial court, the superior court or the probate court a sale should be made of such property or of an interest therein, or a conveyance or transfer should be made thereof in order to carry into effect the objects of the trust, the court may order such sale, conveyance or transfer made and may appoint a suitable person in the place of such trustee to sell, convey or transfer the same in such manner as it may require. If a person so seized or possessed of an estate or entitled thereto upon a trust is within the jurisdiction of the court, he or his guardian may be ordered to make such conveyances as the court orders.
