        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If the action is brought on such bond, the plaintiff shall set forth his original cause of action against the deceased in like manner as would be required in a declaration for the same demand against the executor or administrator, and may allege the non-payment of the claim as a breach of the condition of the bond; and the defendant may answer any matter of defence which would be available against the claim if prosecuted in the usual manner against the executor or administrator.
