    	     If the holder pays or delivers property to the treasurer in good faith and thereafter another person claims the property from the holder or another state claims the money or property under its laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, the commonwealth, upon written notice to the treasurer of the claim, shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim.
