        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 17. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If the probate court finds from the representation of an executor or administrator that the estate of the deceased will probably be insufficient for the payment of his debts, it may appoint two or more commissioners to receive and examine all claims of creditors against such estate, and to return a list of all claims presented to them, with the amount allowed on each. All debts of the estate of said deceased not at the time of such finding barred by any statute of limitations may be allowed either by said commissioners or by said court.
