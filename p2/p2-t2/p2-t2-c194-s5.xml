        Administration shall not be granted to a public administrator when the husband, widow or an heir of the deceased, in writing, claims the right of administration or requests the appointment of some other suitable person to the trust, if such husband, widow, heir or other person accepts the trust and gives the bond required, nor when the sole known assets of the estate of the deceased consist of an amount of money standing to his credit in a savings bank or in a savings account in a trust company, in case such account has not been increased by a deposit, nor decreased by a withdrawal of any part of his deposits or of any part of the interest thereon, during a period of twenty years or more next preceding the petition for such administration.
