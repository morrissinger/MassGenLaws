        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 19. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Upon the allowance of such claim the creditor shall be entitled to a dividend thereon equal to what has been paid to the other creditors, so far as the same can be paid without disturbing the former dividend; and if the claim is not finally established, or if the dividend upon it does not exhaust the assets, the residue shall be divided among all creditors whose claims have been allowed. Any surplus after satisfying the claims of such creditors, with interest, shall be distributed to the persons legally entitled thereto.
