        If an executor or administrator recovers judgment for a debt due the deceased, and levies on real estate, he shall be seized of such real estate in trust for the persons who would have been entitled if the judgment had been satisfied in money; and the real estate so taken shall be considered as personal assets in his hands; and if redeemed, the money shall be received by the executor or administrator, who shall thereupon release the real estate.
