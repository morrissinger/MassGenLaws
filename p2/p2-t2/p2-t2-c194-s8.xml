        Upon the death, resignation or removal of a public administrator, the probate court shall issue a warrant to some other public administrator in the same county, upon his application therefor, requiring him to examine the accounts of such public administrator relative to the estates on which he has taken out letters of administration, and to return to the probate court a statement of all of such estates as are not fully administered and of the balance of each estate remaining in the hands of such public administrator at the time of his death, resignation or removal. And thereupon the court shall issue to the public administrator making the return, upon his giving the requisite bond, letters of administration upon such of said estates as are not already administered, although the personal property remaining may not amount to twenty dollars.
