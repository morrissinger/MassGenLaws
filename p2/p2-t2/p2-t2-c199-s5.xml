        If there is a residue after such payment to the citizens of this commonwealth, it may be paid to any other creditors who have duly proved their debts here, in proportion to the amount due to each of them, but no one shall receive more than would be due to him if the whole estate were divided ratably among all the creditors as before provided. The remainder may be transmitted to the foreign executor or administrator; or if there is none, it shall, after the expiration of four years from the appointment of the administrator, be distributed ratably among all creditors, both citizens and others, who have proved their debts in this commonwealth.
