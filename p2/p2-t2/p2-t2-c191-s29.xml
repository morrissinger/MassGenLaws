See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If a person who is liable to contribute according to the three preceding sections is insolvent or unable to pay his just proportion of the contribution required, the other persons so liable to contribute shall be severally liable for the loss occasioned by such insolvency, each one in proportion to and not exceeding the value of the property received by him from the estate of the deceased; and if a person who is so liable dies without having paid his proportion, his executors and administrators shall be liable therefor in like manner as if it had been his own debt and to the extent to which he would have been liable if living.
