        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 19. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If, after the completion of the list of allowed claims, the assets prove sufficient to pay all such claims, the executor or administrator shall pay them in full; and if any other debt is afterward recovered against him, he shall be liable therefor only to the extent of the assets then remaining. If there are two or more such creditors, the assets, if insufficient to pay their demands in full, shall be divided among them pro rata.
