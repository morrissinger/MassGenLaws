        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 11. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  The right to disclaim an interest in property shall be barred by:--  1. assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge, transfer or other disposition of such interest, or any contract therefor, by the beneficiary or sale or other disposition of such interest pursuant to judicial process made before the beneficiary has disclaimed such interest as herein provided;  2. insolvency of the beneficiary at the time of attempted disclaimer. For purposes of this paragraph only, sections one to four, inclusive, and sections eight to thirteen, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and nine A shall be applicable as if the disclaimer were a conveyance;  3. a written waiver of the right to disclaim such interest pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, signed by the beneficiary, the duly appointed guardian or conservator of a beneficiary under a legal disability, or the legal representative of a deceased beneficiary's estate;  4. acceptance of such interest by the beneficiary; if the beneficiary, having knowledge of the existence of such interest, receives without objection a benefit from such interest, such receipt shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such interest.  The assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge, transfer or other disposition or any contract therefor, sale or other disposition pursuant to judicial process, written waiver of the right to disclaim, or acceptance of a part of an interest in property shall not bar the right to disclaim any other part of such interest.
