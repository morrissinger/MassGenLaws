        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 13. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Upon petition of the widow or of any child of the deceased, the probate court may, after notice, make a reasonable allowance out of the real or personal property in the hands of a special administrator appointed on account of the pendency of a petition relative to the probate of a will or the appointment of an administrator or of an administrator with the will annexed, as an advancement for the support of such widow or children, not exceeding such portion of the estate as they would finally be entitled to. An appeal from a decree relative to such allowance shall not prevent the payment of the allowance, if the petitioner gives bond to the special administrator, with sureties approved by the court and conditioned to repay it if the decree is reversed.
