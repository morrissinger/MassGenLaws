        An executor or administrator with respect to personal property or a guardian, conservator or trustee with respect to real and personal property shall account for such property at its appraised value, but he shall make no profit by the increase nor sustain any loss by the decrease or destruction of any part thereof without his fault. If he sells any of such property for more than its appraised value, he shall account for the excess; if he sells for less than its appraised value, he shall be allowed for the loss if the court finds that the sale was expedient, and for the interest of all concerned; and he shall not be accountable for a debt inventoried as due to the estate if the court finds that it remains uncollected without his fault.
