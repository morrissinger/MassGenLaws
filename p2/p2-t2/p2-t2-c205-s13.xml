        If a license or authority to sell or mortgage real estate is granted to an executor, administrator, guardian, conservator or trustee, no special bond shall be required; but if the court finds the bond already given by him insufficient, it shall, before granting such license or authority, require an additional bond containing the same conditions as are required in the original bond.
