        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 24. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with rights of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or tenants by the entireties, and not as tenants in common.
