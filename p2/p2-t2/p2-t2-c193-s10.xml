        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 13. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If the judge of probate deems it necessary or expedient, he may, at any time and place, with or without notice, appoint a special administrator who, in case of an appeal from the decree appointing him, shall nevertheless proceed in the execution of his duties until it is otherwise ordered by the supreme judicial court, and may in like manner discharge him; provided, however, that no person shall be appointed as a special administrator who is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, murder in the first or second degree, or manslaughter, or accessory before the fact of such crimes, against the deceased. Such appointment and discharge shall be entered forthwith on the records of the court and notice thereof given to the executor or administrator, if any.
