        If the sale is made for the maintenance of the ward and his family, the guardian or conservator shall apply the proceeds, so far as necessary, to that purpose, and shall place the residue on interest or invest it according to his best judgment until the capital is wanted for such maintenance; in such case, the capital may be used for that purpose as if it had been personal property.
