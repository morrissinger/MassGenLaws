        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Property which a testator gives in his lifetime to a pecuniary legatee subsequent to the will providing for such pecuniary legacy, shall be treated to the extent of the gift as satisfaction of the pecuniary legacy in whole or in part only if the will so provides, or if the testator so declared in a contemporaneous writing, or if the legatee has acknowledged in writing that the gift was in satisfaction. For purposes of partial satisfaction, property given during a lifetime shall be valued as of the time the donee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the testator, whichever first occurred.
