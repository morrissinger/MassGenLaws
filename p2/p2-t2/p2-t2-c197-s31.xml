        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 16. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If, under the two preceding sections, more than one person is liable for the debt, the creditor may recover such debt by a suit in equity in the supreme judicial or superior court against such persons so liable as are within reach of process. The court shall determine, by the verdict of a jury if either party requires it, what amount is due to the plaintiff, and shall decide how much each of the defendants is liable to pay toward the debt.
