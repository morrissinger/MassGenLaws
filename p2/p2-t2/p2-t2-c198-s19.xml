        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 19. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  The court may before the expiration of the time allowed for claiming appeals order dividends to be paid to creditors whose claims have been allowed, if there is left an amount sufficient to pay upon claims that may probably be proved afterward a proportion equal to what is so paid to such creditors. Such amount shall remain unappropriated until the final dividend is declared, or until a distribution is ordered.
