See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  Whenever payment of a legacy or distributive share is to be made to a person who is domiciled in a country or state outside of the United States or its territories, in which the court, in its discretion, finds that there is not a reasonable assurance that such legatee or distributee will actually receive payment of his legacy or distributive share in substantially full value, the court, upon petition of the executor, administrator, or an interested party, or in its discretion, may order that such legacy or distributive share be paid, in whole or in part, to said executor, administrator, or interested party for use by him in the purchase of goods in the form of necessaries of life, food, clothing and medicines, to be sent to such legatee or distributee through a recognized public or private agency, upon his written request, order, or assignment.
