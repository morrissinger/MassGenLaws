        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 12. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  If at such hearing the court finds from the copies before it and any additional proof as to the authenticity and execution of the will that the instrument ought to be allowed in this commonwealth as the last will of the deceased, it shall order the copy to be filed and recorded, and the will shall then have the same effect as if it had been originally proved and allowed in the probate court in the usual manner.
