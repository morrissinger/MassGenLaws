        If a judge of probate is obligor, either as principal or as surety, in a bond given to a former judge of the court, any action authorized by this chapter may be brought upon such bond in the name of the judge mentioned therein or in the name of his executor or administrator, and the register of probate for the county in which such bond was given may authorize an action thereon in like manner and upon the same conditions as may be done in other cases by the court.
