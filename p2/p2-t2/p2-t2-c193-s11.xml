        [ Text of section effective until March 31, 2012. Repealed by 2008, 521, Sec. 13. See 2008, 521, Sec. 44 as amended by 2010, 409, Sec. 23 and 2011, 224.]  A special administrator shall collect all the personal property of the deceased and preserve the same for the executor or administrator when appointed, and for that purpose may commence, maintain and defend suits. If he is appointed by reason of delay in granting letters testamentary, the court may authorize him to take charge of the real property of the deceased or of any part thereof, and collect rents, make necessary repairs and do all other things which it may consider needful for the preservation of such real property and as a charge thereon. His compensation shall be such as the court allows.
