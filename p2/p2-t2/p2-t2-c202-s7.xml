        To obtain such license, the executor, administrator, guardian or conservator shall file a petition stating the value of the personal property in his hands, the amount of the charges of administration or management, the amount of debts due from the deceased or ward, as nearly as can be ascertained, and, if a person dies testate, the amount of any legacies given in his will. If it is necessary to sell a part only of the real estate, the value, description and condition of the part which it is proposed to sell may also be set forth, and the court may direct what specific part shall be sold.
