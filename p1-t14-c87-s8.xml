No such tree, shrub or other growth shall be trimmed, cut or removed by any person other than an agent or employee of the department, even if he be the owner of the fee in the land on which such tree, shrub or growth is situated, except upon a permit in writing from the department. Any person injured in his property by the action of the department as to the trimming, cutting, removal or retention of any such tree, shrub or other growth, may recover the damages, if any, which he has sustained, from the commonwealth under chapter seventy-nine.
