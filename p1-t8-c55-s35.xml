        Upon a complaint subscribed and sworn to by any person before a district court, alleging that reasonable grounds exist for believing that any law relating to the qualification or registration of voters, or to voting lists or ballots, or to primaries, caucuses, conventions and elections, or to any matters pertaining thereto, has been violated, such court may at once hold an inquest to inquire into such alleged violation of law.
