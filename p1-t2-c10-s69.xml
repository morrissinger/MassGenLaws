        There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth a separate fund to be known as Securities Fraud Prosecution Fund. There shall be credited to the fund all criminal penalties, fines and settlements not intended to compensate victims of securities fraud due the commonwealth collected under chapter 110A and any income derived from investment of amounts credited to the fund. Amounts credited to the fund shall be received and held in trust for investigations and enforcement of chapter 110A. Revenues and expenditures of the fund shall be reported on the Massachusetts management and accounting and reporting system and maintained by the state treasurer. The Fund shall not exceed a maximum of $500,000. Amounts collected in excess of the maximum shall be deposited in the General Fund.
