Any such corporation shall have the power, with the approval of the housing board, to sell, exchange, give or otherwise transfer in whole or in part the land or interests therein, including air rights, leased or acquired by it under this chapter, with the buildings or other structures thereon, constituting a project or portion hereunder to any corporation organized under section three or section eighteen B, insurance company or companies authorized under section eighteen, bank or banks authorized under section eighteen A, or any other authorized entity under this chapter, a housing authority, redevelopment authority, or the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities but such land or interests therein, including air rights, buildings or other structures may be sold only subject to the further requirement that any change in the benefits and restrictions applicable to the grantee, donee or transferee and any other changes in the project shall not be valid unless approved in the manner provided in section six, except the city of Boston and Springfield, or section eighteen B, as the case may be.
