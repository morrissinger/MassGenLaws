The said department, upon application, may extend the period of storage beyond twelve months for a particular consignment of goods, if the goods in question are found upon examination to be in proper condition for further storage at the end of such time. The length of time for which further storage is allowed shall be specified by the department. A report on each case in which such extension of storage is permitted, including information relating to the reason for the action of said department, the kind and amount of goods for which the storage period was extended, and the period of extension, shall be included in the annual report of the commissioner of public health.
