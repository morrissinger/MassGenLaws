        The Massachusetts hospital school shall be maintained primarily for the education and care of crippled and deformed children of the commonwealth. When there is no child of the commonwealth on the entrance waiting list, crippled children from outside the commonwealth may be admitted to said hospital school, subject to such rules and regulations as the board of trustees may adopt; provided, however, that all costs for the care and treatment of such children are paid by their sponsors or other persons or agencies. 
Subject to appropriation and subject to the provisions of sections twenty-five B to twenty-five G, inclusive, the department shall also be authorized to establish at the Massachusetts hospital school any inpatient or outpatient services, including but not limited to medical, surgical, restorative, rehabilitative or chronic services, mental health and mental retardation services, extended care services, dental services, rehabilitative therapy services, family planning services, services for treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction, skilled nursing care services, intermediate care facility services, and residency care services.
