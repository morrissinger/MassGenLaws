        Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, a municipality with a comprehensive water resources management plan under review or approved by the department of environmental protection may establish and maintain a separate account into which it may collect and deposit and expend funds from property owners for the difference in cost between a conventional subsurface wastewater disposal system as required in 310 CMR 15.00, et seq. and the cost of a subsurface wastewater disposal system designed to reduce the nitrogen discharge from said system as long as the property in question is identified in the CWMP as being a priority for the installation of a wastewater collection and treatment system for the purposes of reducing the impacts of excessive nitrogen on marine waters and drinking water supplies. Funds from this account may be used only for the purpose of the construction, maintenance and operation of said wastewater treatment and collection works and shall be applied to the costs of connection and or betterment assessed to the property in question.
