The department may accept, receive and use money, goods or services given for the general purposes of the department by the federal government or from any other source, public or private, and may comply with such conditions and enter into such agreements upon such covenants, terms and conditions as the department deems necessary or desirable, provided the agreement is not in conflict with state law.
