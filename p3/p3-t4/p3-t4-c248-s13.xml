        If by reason of the illness or infirmity of the prisoner he cannot without danger be taken to the place appointed for the return of the writ, that fact shall be stated in the statement and, if proved, the judge may proceed to the place where the prisoner is confined and there make his examination; or he may postpone the examination or may make such other order in the case as law and justice require.
