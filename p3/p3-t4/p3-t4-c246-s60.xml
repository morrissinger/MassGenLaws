        If the court finds that property in the hands of a person summoned as trustee is mortgaged, pledged or in any way liable for the payment of a debt to the person so summoned, it may allow the attaching creditor to pay or tender the amount due to the trustee, who shall thereupon deliver the property, in the manner before provided, to the officer holding the execution.
