        If the conusor dies before the debt is fully paid, no execution therefor shall issue as of course, but his estate shall be liable for the debt in like manner as if judgment therefor had been rendered against him in his lifetime; and the conusee or his executor or administrator may recover the same from the executor, administrator, heirs or devisees of the conusor. Such debt may be recovered by civil action in the superior court or in a district court.
