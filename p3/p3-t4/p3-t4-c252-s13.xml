        If the commissioners find it necessary or expedient to lower or raise the water to obtain a view of the land or for the more convenient or expeditious removal of obstructions, they may open the flood gates of any mill or make other needful passages through or around the dam thereof, or erect a temporary dam on the land of a person not a party to the proceedings, and may maintain such dam or passages as long as necessary for such purposes; but before so doing, they shall give to such person reasonable written notice of their intention. If such person appeals from their decision and gives reasonable written notice thereof to any commissioner, the commissioners shall suspend all proceedings upon his land until such appeal is determined; provided, that the petition therefor is entered in the superior court for the county where the greater part of the land improved lies not later than thirty days after the time of giving such notice.
