        The libel shall be entered and conducted as a civil action; and if after notice no claimant appears, the court shall, upon a hearing, decree a forfeiture, restoration or other appropriate disposition of the property. If a claimant appears, he may allege and answer any matter material for his defence, and either party shall be entitled to claim a jury trial upon issues of fact as in other civil actions.
