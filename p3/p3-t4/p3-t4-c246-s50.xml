        If a person summoned as trustee in his own right dies before the judgment recovered by the plaintiff has been fully satisfied, the goods, effects and credits in his hands at the time of the attachment shall remain bound thereby, and his executor or administrator shall be bound thereby, as if the summons were originally served on him.
