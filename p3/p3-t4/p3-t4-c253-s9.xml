        If it is alleged in the plaintiffâ€™s complaint that the dam has been raised to an unreasonable height, or that it ought not to be kept up and closed during the whole year, the jury shall determine by their verdict how much, if at all, the dam shall be lowered and whether it shall be left open, and, if so, during what part of the year.
