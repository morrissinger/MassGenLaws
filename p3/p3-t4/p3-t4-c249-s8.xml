        If the court finds that the defendant has not exercised a franchise or privilege not conferred by law, he shall recover costs. If the attorney general does not intervene, and the court finds that the respondent has exercised a franchise or privilege not conferred by law, judgment of forfeiture shall not be entered, but judgment shall be entered that the corporation, or the persons claiming to be such, be perpetually excluded from the exercise of such franchise or privilege, and that the directors, managers, or agents, guilty of the usurpation, pay the costs of the complainant.
