        The plaintiff may from time to time examine the alleged trustee upon written interrogatories filed in the clerkâ€™s office. The answers thereto shall be signed, sworn to and filed in said office within seven days after notice to the trustee or his attorney of the filing of the interrogatories, unless the court otherwise orders. If the answers are not so filed, the court may make such order as the case may require.
