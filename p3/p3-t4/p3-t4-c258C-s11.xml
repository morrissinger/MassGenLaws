        Acceptance of any compensation under this chapter shall subrogate the commonwealth, to the extent of such compensation paid, to any right or right of action accruing to the claimant or to the victim to recover payments on account of losses resulting from the crime with respect to which the compensation has been paid, and the claimant has a continuing obligation to so notify the attorney general of such recovery. The attorney general may enforce the subrogation, and he shall bring suit to recover from any person to whom compensation is paid, to the extent of compensation actually paid under this chapter, any amount received by the claimant from any source exceeding the actual loss to the victim.
