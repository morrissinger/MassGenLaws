    <text>
        The value of any property so delivered shall be ascertained and fixed, as between the trustee and defendant, in like manner and upon the same principles as if delivered to the defendant. Upon application of either party, the court may, pending the original action or civil action under section forty-five, determine the value, and make any other order relative to such property and to the delivery thereof necessary or proper to protect the rights of the trustee or of the defendant.
