        When a foreign corporation having a usual place of business in the commonwealth is summoned as a trustee in an action against one of its employees, service of the summons may be made as provided in section thirty-eight or thirty-nine of chapter two hundred and twenty-three, or upon any paymaster or other officer or agent of the corporation whose duty it is to pay such employee, and such service shall be as binding upon the corporation as if it had been made upon the commissioner of revenue or the commissioner of insurance.
