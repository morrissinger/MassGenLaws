        In a proceeding brought under section forty-five, if the trustee appears and answers, he may be examined; but if he has been examined in the original action, he shall be examined again only by order of the court. A trustee may prove any matter necessary or proper for his defense; and any judgment rendered against him shall express the amount for which he is chargeable.
