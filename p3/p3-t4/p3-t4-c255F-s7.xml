    	     A mortgage loan originator’s license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for a period of not more than 1 year. The division may renew a mortgage loan originator’s license upon the submission of documents showing that: (i) the mortgage loan originator remains in compliance with this chapter; (ii) the mortgage loan originator has satisfied the annual continuing education requirements pursuant to section 8; and (iii) the mortgage loan originator has paid all required fees for renewal of the license. The license of a mortgage loan originator failing to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal shall expire.

        <section prefix="b">
    	     The commissioner may adopt procedures for the reinstatement of expired licenses consistent with the standards established by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. A mortgage loan originator licensed pursuant to this chapter who subsequently becomes unlicensed shall complete the continuing education requirements for the last year in which the license was held prior to issuance of a new or renewed license.
