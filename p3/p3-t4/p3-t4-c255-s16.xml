        A place in which the vessel is wholly or partly constructed shall be held to be the port where she was when the debt was contracted. The lien shall not be affected by any inaccuracy in the description of the vessel, if she can be recognized thereby, nor in stating the amount due for labor or materials, unless it is found that the person filing the statement has knowingly claimed more than is due.
