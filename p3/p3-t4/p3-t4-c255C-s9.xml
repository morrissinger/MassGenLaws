        Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, or knowingly makes any incorrect statement of a material fact in any application, report or statement filed pursuant to this chapter, or knowingly omits to state any material fact necessary to give the commissioner any information lawfully required by him or refuses to permit any lawful investigation or examination, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
A premium finance agencyâ€™s taking or receiving from or charging an insured a greater charge than authorized in this chapter shall not invalidate the premium finance agreement or the principal balance payable thereunder but may be adjudged a forfeiture of all charges which the premium finance agreement carries with it or which have been agreed to be paid thereon, and if a greater charge has been paid by an insured, the person paying the same or his legal representative may recover from the premium finance agency twice the entire amount of the charges thus paid if action is brought within two years from the time of such payment.
