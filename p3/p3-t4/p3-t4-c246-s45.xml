    <text>
        If a person adjudged a trustee does not, upon demand, pay over to the officer goods, effects or credits sufficient to satisfy the execution and if the execution is not otherwise satisfied, the plaintiff may commence an action in the court in which the judgment was rendered to have the original judgment, or the amount remaining unsatisfied, satisfied from the goods and estate of the trustee or trustees. Such an action may be commenced at any time after thirty days from the date of judgment.
