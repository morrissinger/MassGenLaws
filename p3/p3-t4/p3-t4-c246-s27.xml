        If, after the service of process on the trustee, but before he has knowledge thereof, he makes any payment in good faith or becomes liable to a third person by reason of the goods, effects or credits in his hands, or delivers such goods, effects or credits to the defendant or to any other person who may be entitled thereto, he shall be allowed therefor in the same manner as if the payment or delivery had been made, or as if the liability had been incurred, before the service of process.
