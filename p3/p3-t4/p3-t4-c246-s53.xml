        If a person summoned as trustee dies after judgment in the original action, his executor or administrator may pay upon the execution the amount which the deceased would have been liable to pay were he living, and he shall be discharged from all further demands on account thereof in the manner before mentioned. If he refuses to make such payment, the plaintiff may proceed against him as provided in section forty-five.
