        A person having an interest by assignment or otherwise in money or credits attached by the trustee process in an action against another may, at any time before final judgment, dissolve such attachment or a part thereof by giving bond, in a sum not exceeding the damages demanded, with sufficient sureties to be approved in writing by the plaintiff or his attorney, by a master in chancery or by a justice of a court, if the attachment is made within the jurisdiction thereof, conditioned to pay to the plaintiff, within thirty days after final judgment or after a special judgment entered under section twenty-five of chapter two hundred and thirty-five, the amount for which the trustee may be charged, not exceeding the value of the property in his hands, or so much thereof as will satisfy the amount which may be recovered by the plaintiff. If there are several trustees, such bonds may be made to apply to one or more. The provisions of sections one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and twenty-six of chapter two hundred and twenty-three, relative to notice, hearing, fees and the filing of the bond, shall apply to bonds given under this section.
