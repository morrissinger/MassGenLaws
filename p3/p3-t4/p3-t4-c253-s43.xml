        The court in which an action for such compensation is pending shall, if requested by the plaintiff, require such corporation to give satisfactory security for the payment of all damages and costs which may be awarded thereon, and if the court finds that the security has become insufficient, it shall require the corporation to give further security. If the corporation neglects for one month or for such further time as the court allows to comply with any such order, it shall lose all rights under this chapter, and the court may restrain it from flowing or injuring such land or property until such security has been given.
