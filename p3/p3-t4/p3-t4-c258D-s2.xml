        A claimant shall not be entitled to compensation from the commonwealth for any incarceration or portion thereof, which was or will be credited toward a sentence for, or during which the claimant was also serving a concurrent sentence for the conviction of another crime. In those cases in which only a pardon from the governor is used to support a pending action against the commonwealth brought under this chapter, the subsequent exercise of the governorâ€™s authority to revoke such pardon pursuant to section 152 of chapter 127 shall immediately negate the validity of any such pending action and the superior court shall immediately issue a summary judgment in favor of the commonwealth on such grounds.
