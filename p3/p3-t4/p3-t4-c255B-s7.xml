        A license may be suspended or revoked by the commissioner on the following grounds:—(1) material misstatement in application for license; (2) failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter; (3) defrauding any retail buyer to the buyer’s damage; (4) fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention or concealment by the licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to the retail buyer under this chapter. 
If a licensee is a firm, association or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of its license that any officer, director or trustee of a licensed firm, association or corporation, or any member of a licensed partnership, has so acted or failed to act as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual. Each licensee shall be responsible for the acts of any of his employees while acting as his agent, if such licensee after actual knowledge of said acts retained the benefits, proceeds, profits or advantages accruing from said acts or otherwise ratified said acts.
