    <text>
        If a person so summoned dies before judgment in the original action, his executor or administrator may appear voluntarily or may be cited to appear, as in other cases. The further proceedings shall then be conducted in the same manner as if the executor or administrator had been originally summoned as trustee, except that the examination of the deceased, if any has been filed, shall have the same effect as if he were living.
