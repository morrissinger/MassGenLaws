        The owner of any dam shall file with the commissioner on or before July 1, 2003, and before operating any dam constructed thereafter, on such form or forms prescribed by the commissioner, a dam registration form containing the name of the owner, the location and the dimensions of the dam and such other information as the commissioner may require by regulation. A registration form shall not be deemed received by the commissioner until all information specifically required by statute or regulation is submitted. Failure to file a dam registration form by the time prescribed shall subject the owner to fines prescribed by regulation, and an inspection by the commissioner who may enter the property of the owner to obtain the requisite information. The registered owner of any dam shall notify the commissioner, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of the transfer of legal title of the dam and any of changes for which the department may require notice by regulation, not later than 10 days after the date of such transfer or change. Upon receipt and approval of the dam registration form, the department shall issue a certificate of registration to each dam owner.
