        The lien of a bailee of personal property exceeding twenty dollars in value to secure a claim for which he has a lien, shall, if the amount of such claim has been agreed upon or otherwise established, terminate upon tender, at any time before the property is lawfully sold to satisfy the lien, by the bailor or upon his behalf, or by any other person otherwise having the right of possession, of a bond in a penal sum equal to twice the amount of such claim, signed by a surety company qualified to act in the commonwealth, or by sureties approved by a justice of a district court or a master in chancery in the county where the property is held, and conditioned to pay the amount found due on such claim to the bailee within thirty days after final judgment, or order of sale of such property. In any suit to replevy any such property held to secure such a claim, a bond as described herein shall satisfy the requirements of section eight of chapter two hundred and forty-seven.
