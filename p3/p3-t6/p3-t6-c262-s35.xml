        The fee for lawfully solemnizing and certifying a marriage shall not exceed $100 if performed in the justice of the peace’s home community or $150 if performed in any municipality in the commonwealth; provided, however, that no additional charge shall be made for travel in connection with such solemnization notwithstanding any law to the contrary. Nor shall any additional charge be made by a justice of the peace, for providing flowers, for providing music, for providing a photographer, for providing a location where the marriage ceremony takes place, or for providing an unofficial certificate of marriage. Additional charges are allowable for prenuptial counseling conferences, rehearsals, and other special requests by the couple whose marriage is being solemnized; provided, however, that the amount of these additional charges must be disclosed in writing to the couple whose marriage is being solemnized at least forty-eight hours prior to the rendering of these services. The total fee for lawfully solemnizing and certifying a marriage shall not exceed the fee limit fixed for solemnizing and certifying a marriage in a justice of the peace’s home community where a municipal employee who is also a justice of the peace solemnizes a marriage in a municipal building at a time when said building is regularly open for business.
