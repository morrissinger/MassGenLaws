        If the condition of the mortgage is not for the payment of money, or if a part only of the money, the payment of which is secured by the mortgage, is due, the court shall vary the terms of the judgment as the case may require, but shall award execution as before provided unless the defendant within two months after the judgment performs the conditions thereof.
