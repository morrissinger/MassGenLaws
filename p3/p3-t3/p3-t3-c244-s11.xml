    <text>
        If a conditional judgment has been entered upon a mortgage containing a power of sale, the court shall, instead of issuing a writ of possession, at the request of the plaintiff order the property to be sold pursuant to such power. The plaintiff shall thereupon execute the power and do all things required by it or by the court.
