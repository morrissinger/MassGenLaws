        If trial by jury shall be demanded and if issues therefor are to be framed to obtain an assessment of the amounts due to the plaintiff for rents and profits or other damages, or a determination of the amount to be allowed to the defendant for improvements, or of the value of the plaintiffâ€™s estate, the land court, on its own motion, or on that of either party, made at any time before the papers required by section fifteen of chapter one hundred and eighty-five have been entered in the superior court, may postpone such issues until after its trial of the title and its findings or decision thereon. In such case said court shall order that the procedure provided by section fifteen of chapter one hundred and eighty-five be suspended pending its further order under section twenty-three.
