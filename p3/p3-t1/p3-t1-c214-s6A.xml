        Notwithstanding any of the provisions of section six so far as they may be applicable, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction may be granted in any case in which the parties to a jurisdictional dispute, as hereinafter defined, have voluntarily submitted such dispute to arbitration, and one of such parties fails to abide by the arbitration procedure or to comply with the terms of the arbitration award and engages in or continues to engage in a strike, picketing, boycott or other concerted interference against an employer. The restraining order or preliminary injunction may be granted in favor of the party which abides by the procedure and complies with the award as well as in favor of the employer who is ready and willing to abide by the terms of such award. 
The term “jurisdictional dispute” means a dispute between two or more labor organizations or groups or employees the object of which is to require that particular work be assigned to employees in a particular labor organization or in a particular trade, craft or class rather than to employees in another labor organization or in another trade, craft or class.
