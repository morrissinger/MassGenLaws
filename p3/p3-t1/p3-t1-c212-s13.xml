        If, by mistake or accident, an appeal to the superior court is not duly entered therein, or if, for a like reason, a complaint founded on an omission to enter an appeal has not been entered by the appellee, the court, upon petition filed within one year after the appeal or complaint should have been entered, may upon terms allow the appeal or complaint to be entered; but attachments made and security given in the original action shall not thereby be revived or continued in force.
