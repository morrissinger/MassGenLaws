        When a civil action is at issue and is not governed by chapter two hundred and twenty-one B or by the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure or by any extensions thereof to domestic relations actions, the justice of the probate and family court division may appoint one or more masters to hear the parties, examine their vouchers and evidence, state accounts and report upon such matters therein as may be ordered by the court. The report shall be prima facie evidence upon such matters as are expressly referred to such masters.
