        Persons serving in or with the armed forces of the United States or their dependents, wherever located, may acknowledge any instrument, in the manner and form required by the laws of this commonwealth, before any commissioned officer in the active service of the armed forces of the United States with the rank of second lieutenant or higher in the army, air force or marine corps, or ensign or higher in the navy or United States coast guard. Any such instrument shall contain a statement that the person executing the instrument is serving in or with the armed forces of the United States or is a dependent of a person serving in or with the armed forces of the United States, and in either case the statement shall include the serial number of the person so serving. No such instrument shall be rendered invalid by the failure to state therein the place of execution or acknowledgment. 
No authentication of the officerâ€™s certificate of acknowledgment shall be required. 
Instruments so acknowledged outside of the commonwealth, if otherwise in accordance with law, shall be received and may be used in evidence, or for any other purpose, in the same manner as if taken before a commissioner of the commonwealth appointed to take depositions in other states.
