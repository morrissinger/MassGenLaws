    <text>
        Parties to probate proceedings may select the newspapers in which the notices ordered upon their petitions shall be published, preference to be given to a newspaper, if any, published in the town where the deceased last dwelt, unless, in the judgment of the register, the interests of all parties require publication in some other locality; but the court may order the notice published in one other newspaper.
