Such rules shall specify that the parties shall receive adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and present relevant evidence in all proceedings. Such rules shall establish all procedures for child support cases, including initiation of actions, conduct of proceedings before the hearing officers, and approval of hearing officersâ€™ orders and judgments by justices of the trial court departments.
