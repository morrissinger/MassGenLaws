        No person in the employ of, or in any capacity attached to or connected with, any hospital, infirmary or other institution, public or private, which receives patients for medical or surgical treatment, shall communicate, directly or indirectly, with any attorney at law, or any person representing such attorney, for the purpose of enabling such attorney, or any associate or employee of such attorney, to solicit employment to present a claim for damages or prosecute an action for the enforcement thereof, on behalf of any patient in any such institution. No such person in the employ of any hospital shall negotiate or attempt to negotiate the settlement of any such claim. A district court, upon complaint alleging violation of any provision of this section by any person employed by, or attached to, or connected with, any such hospital, infirmary or other institution situated within its judicial district, may issue an order of notice to the person complained of to show cause why he should not be ordered to desist and refrain from violation of any such provision on penalty of contempt.
