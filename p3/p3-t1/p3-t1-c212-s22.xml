        Every Monday shall be a return day in the superior court department for the entry of suits upon recognizances and bonds in criminal cases held in the district court department. Such suits may be made returnable at the election of the district attorney at any such return day within three months after the date of the writ. Trials by jury of such suits shall take place at criminal sittings; and, for the purpose of docketing and recording such suits, they shall be deemed to be criminal cases, provided that the provisions of chapter two hundred and twenty-seven shall be applicable thereto as in other civil cases except that no bond shall be required as provided in section nine thereof. If any Monday is a legal holiday, such entry shall be made on the day following. This section shall not apply to appeals arising under sections fifty-two to sixty-three, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and nineteen.
