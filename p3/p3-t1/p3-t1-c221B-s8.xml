        Within three business days of the hearing officer’s decision, any party may seek reconsideration of that decision to a justice of the division in which the decision was rendered. In such cases, it shall be the burden of the party seeking reconsideration to show cause that the order of the hearing officer should not stand. The reconsideration hearing may consist of the presentation of evidence and argument to the justice, who may alter the decision of the hearing officer only on written findings. Approval of the hearing officer’s decision under section seven shall not limit the right to reconsideration under this section.
