        If a master appointed by the probate and family court department becomes incapacitated or dies without having filed his final report the court may award him or his estate reasonable compensation, payable by the commonwealth, upon a finding that he actually performed services which would entitle him to the compensation awarded had he filed a report as provided in section sixty-two; provided, that all his records and memoranda, or copies thereof, in the case in which compensation is sought, are filed with the register of the court.
