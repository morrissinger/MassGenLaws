    <text>
        Any party to a civil proceeding assigned to trial before an auditor or master may, upon motion duly made to the court, have such proceedings recorded at his own expense. Such party shall include in his motion the name of the official stenographer to be designated by the court. Said official stenographer, after being duly sworn, may take notes of all testimony adduced before the auditor or master. The transcripts thereof, after certification by said stenographer, shall be admissible in evidence in any further trial or hearing of the matter as evidence of testimony given, whenever proof of such testimony is otherwise competent.
