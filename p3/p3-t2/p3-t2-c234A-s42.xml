        The court shall take whatever actions are appropriate to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Upon a finding by the court that a juror will not appear to perform or complete juror service or in response to the courtâ€™s order, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the juror or may take such other appropriate actions as are likely to compel the juror to appear before the court. Any grand or trial juror who fails to appear for juror service or who fails to perform any condition of his juror service shall be guilty of a crime, and upon conviction thereof, may be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars.
