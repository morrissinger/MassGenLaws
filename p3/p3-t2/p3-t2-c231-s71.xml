        In civil proceedings which are not governed by the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure or by the District-Municipal Courts Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may make orders allowing amendments before trial, or a supplemental pleading, or any other interlocutory order necessary to prepare the case for trial but the court shall make such rules relative to notice, the times and places for motions at chambers, and other matters, as shall from time to time be necessary.
