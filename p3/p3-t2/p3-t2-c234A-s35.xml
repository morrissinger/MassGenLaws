    <text>
        Grand and trial jurors shall be summoned at random from the entire judicial district to perform juror service at any particular location within the judicial district, unless the supreme judicial court, by rule of court, orders otherwise. The office of jury commissioner and the court shall have discretionary authority to permit a juror to perform his juror service at a different jury-trial location within the judicial district upon a finding that hardship will be imposed upon the juror if he were required to serve at the original location. The jury commissioner, with the approval of the jury management advisory committee, shall have discretionary authority to limit the numbers of courthouse transfers allowed each day to or from each courthouse in order to maintain the integrity of the demographic cross-sections appearing in the juror pools.
