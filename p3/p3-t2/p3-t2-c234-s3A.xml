        The presiding justice at a sitting of the court with juries may, in his discretion, postpone the whole or any part of the time of service of a juror to a later day during the same or a subsequent sitting; and the presiding justice may thereupon make an order that such juror whose term of service is so postponed to a day certain, shall attend at the opening of the court on that day, and thereafter, until he is discharged from such service. But no such juror whose term of service or part thereof is postponed shall be required to serve for a greater number of days than he would have been required to serve if such postponement had not been granted.
