        Every grand or trial juror shall return the juror confirmation form, duly completed and signed, within ten days after receipt by him of the juror summons. The office of jury commissioner shall provide a prepaid and addressed envelope for this purpose. If the juror is unable to complete and sign the form, he may authorize another person to complete and sign the form on his behalf. A notice of the jurorâ€™s duty to return the completed confirmation form within ten days of its receipt shall appear prominently on the face of the confirmation form. Where a juror is unable to return a juror confirmation form because of its loss or destruction or where there is insufficient time for the juror to confirm by mail, the office of jury commissioner may accept an oral confirmation from the juror by telephone or in person. Such oral confirmation shall be as valid and binding as if the confirmation were made in writing.
