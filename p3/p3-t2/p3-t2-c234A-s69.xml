        A translator may assist a deaf juror during the juror orientation program, the juror’s welcome, and the judicial discretion hearing. As a matter of discretion, the court may permit a translator to assist a deaf juror during the trial after a determination of the competency of the translator. In the presence of the jury, the court shall instruct the translator to make true, literal and complete translations of all testimony and other relevant colloquy to the deaf juror to the best of his ability. The court may permit a translator to be present and assist a deaf juror during the deliberations of the jury. In the presence of the jury, the court shall instruct the translator to refrain from participating in any manner in the deliberations of the jury and to refrain from having any communications, oral or visual, with any member of the jury regarding the deliberations of the jury except for the literal translations of jurors’ remarks made during deliberations. The verdict of the jury shall be valid notwithstanding the presence of the translator during deliberations.
