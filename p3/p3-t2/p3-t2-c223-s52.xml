        If personal property has been sold or disposed of by consent of the parties, or after an appraisal as hereinafter provided, the proceeds, while remaining in the hands of the officer, shall be liable to be further attached by him as the property of the original defendant, in the manner in which the property itself might have been attached; and shall be held and disposed of in the same manner as if the attachment had been made on the property itself before the sale thereof. The foregoing provision shall not prevent the officer from paying over to the defendant the surplus of the proceeds of such sale, after retaining enough to satisfy all the attachments actually existing at the time of such payment.
