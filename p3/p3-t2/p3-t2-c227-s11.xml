        If the execution in an action under this chapter, except as otherwise provided, is levied on land, no alienation thereof by the original plaintiff shall prevent the defendant from retaking the same or as much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment or order he recovers upon a proceeding for relief from judgment commenced within one year after the original judgment.
