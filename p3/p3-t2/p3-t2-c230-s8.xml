        If a judgment for costs is rendered against an executor or administrator in an action commenced by or against him, or in an action commenced by or against the testator or intestate, wherein the executor or administrator has appeared and taken upon himself the prosecution or defence, he shall be personally liable for the costs, and execution shall be awarded against his body, goods and estate, as if it were for his own debt. Costs paid by him shall be allowed in his account unless the probate court determines that the action was prosecuted or defended without reasonable cause.
