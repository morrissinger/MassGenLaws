        If, within four months after an attachment of property has been made on mesne process in a civil action founded on a claim which would, if proved, be barred by a discharge in insolvency of the defendant and after such attachment has been dissolved as provided in the four preceding sections, proceedings in insolvency are instituted by or against the defendant, the action shall, upon the suggestion of any party interested, be continued to await the result of such proceedings in insolvency; and if the debtor receives his discharge in insolvency, the sureties on the bond given by him to dissolve the attachment shall be released from all liability thereon.
