    <text>
        An officer serving an execution shall deliver to the creditor or to his attorney seisin and possession of the land taken thereon, so far as the nature of the estate and the title of the debtor will admit; but if the estate taken is a remainder, reversion or right of redemption, the officer shall not oust the person lawfully in possession of the land, but shall assign to the creditor the right which the debtor had therein, and make his return accordingly.
