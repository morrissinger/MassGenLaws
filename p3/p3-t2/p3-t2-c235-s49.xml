        If an officer, who has begun to serve an execution or other writ or process, dies or becomes incapable of completing the service and return thereof, the service may be completed by any officer qualified to serve it; or in case of illness or absence, the judgment creditor or the officer who began to serve the writ or process may delegate any officer qualified to serve it temporarily to act for him during said illness or absence. If the first officer has not made a certificate of his doings, the second officer shall certify whatever he finds to have been done by the first officer, and shall add thereto a certificate of his own doings.
