    <text>
        The forms of execution shall be the same as have heretofore been established by law and the usage and practice of the courts. Executions issued upon judgments in civil actions in favor of the commonwealth shall be in form like those in favor of natural persons. Executions issued by a district court for an amount as damages exceeding twenty dollars shall be so framed as to direct a levy upon the lands and tenements of the debtor. Alterations in the forms may be made by the courts, subject to the final control of the supreme judicial court, which may by general rules regulate such changes in all courts of the commonwealth.
