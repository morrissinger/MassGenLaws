        If an attachment is made of articles of personal property which, by reason of their bulk or for other cause, cannot be immediately removed, a certified copy of the writ of attachment together with a certified copy of the officer’s endorsement on the original writ of attachment of the date or dates of the executing of the writ, may, within three days after the attachment, be deposited in the office of the state secretary where filing would be required to perfect a security interest in such goods under article 9 of chapter 106 as if the debtor were located in the commonwealth under section 9-307 of said chapter 106. If the goods are fixtures, alternatively, the certified copy of the writ of attachment together with a certified copy of the officer’s endorsement on the original writ of attachment of the date or dates of the executing of the writ, may, within 3 days after the attachment, be deposited in the registry to deeds of the real estate registry in which the goods are located. In either case, such attachment shall thereupon be as valid and effectual as if the articles had been retained in the possession and custody of the officer.
