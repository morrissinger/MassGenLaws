        If the condition of a recognizance or bond taken under this chapter is broken, the creditor may, within one year after such breach, commence an action thereon; and judgment shall be entered for the amount of the penalty, but execution shall issue for so much thereof only as may be justly and equitably due. Such actions in favor of the commonwealth shall be brought in the court in which the original judgment was rendered.
