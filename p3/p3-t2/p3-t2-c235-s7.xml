        If in such action any defendants are defaulted, and upon trial any of the others are found liable, the court shall render judgment both against those defaulted and those found liable for the debt or damages, with costs to the time of the default, and against those who defend, for all costs which accrue after the default; and shall issue separate executions on such judgment.
