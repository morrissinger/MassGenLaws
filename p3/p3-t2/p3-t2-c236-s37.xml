        If an execution is levied on rents and profits of a life estate, the debtor may, at any time before the debt with interest thereon is fully satisfied, redeem the same by paying or tendering to the creditor the amount then due to him; and the proceedings relative to such redemption shall be the same as are provided for the redemption of other land.
