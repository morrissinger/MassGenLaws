        The aldermen or selectmen shall cause the names on the list as completed to be written each on a separate ballot and shall roll or fold the ballots so as to resemble each other as much as possible and so that the name written thereon shall not be visible on the outside, and shall place the ballots in a box kept by the city or town clerk for that purpose.
