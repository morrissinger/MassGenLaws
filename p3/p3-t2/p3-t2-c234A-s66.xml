    <text>
        Following the welcome to the jurors, the court shall hold a private hearing with each juror or employer of a juror who requests to be heard. The purpose of such hearings shall be to dispose of all urgent personal problems of jurors and employers as to possible excuses, postponements, limitations on length of juror service, compensation, reimbursement, qualifications for juror service, or any other condition of juror service. The office of jury commissioner, with the approval of the committee, may prepare suggested guidelines for the judicial discretion hearing. The court may permit observers in the judicial discretion hearing for educational purposes as long as the identities of jurors are kept confidential by such observers and the personal decorum of the hearing is not lost thereby.
