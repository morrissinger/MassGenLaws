        If the original judgment was for seisin of the land demanded in a real action, the writ of seisin may be issued in favor of the plaintiff without his giving bond; and if the judgment is reversed in whole or in part upon a review or other proceeding, whether sued out or commenced within the year or afterward, the original defendant may have restitution of the land.
