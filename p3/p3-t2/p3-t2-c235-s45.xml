        If an attachment or seizure on execution is made of any property which may be attached without taking and keeping the exclusive possession thereof, and if the same property is subsequently attached or taken on execution by another officer, he shall give notice thereof to the officer who made the first attachment or seizure; and if the latter, before he receives such notice, pays to the debtor the balance of the proceeds of a sale, he shall not be liable therefor to the person claiming under such subsequent attachment or seizure.
