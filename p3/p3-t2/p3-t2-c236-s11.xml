        Land levied upon, whether an entire parcel or an undivided part, and whether the debtorâ€™s estate therein is a fee simple or a less estate, and whether it is in possession, reversion or remainder, shall be described, by metes and bounds or otherwise, with as much precision as is necessary in a deed of land, and in such manner that the land may be known and identified. Such description may be contained in the certificate of the appraisers or in the return of the officer, and the description in either may be referred to and adopted in the other.
