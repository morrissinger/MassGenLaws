        Personal property which has been attached or taken on execution by a constable may be further attached or taken on execution by a deputy sheriff or other competent officer, upon any writ of attachment or execution which such constable is not qualified to serve; and thereupon such constable shall make return upon and deliver his writ or execution, with the possession of the property, to such deputy sheriff or other officer, who shall complete the service thereof. If such writ of attachment has been returned into court, the constable shall file in the case a certificate of the fact of such surrender of possession.
