        If the interest of the deceased party passes to the surviving plaintiffs, or if there is no motion for the admission of an heir or devisee at the sitting when the death of the deceased party is suggested or within such further time as the court allows, the surviving plaintiffs may prosecute the action for so much of the land in question as they may then claim.
