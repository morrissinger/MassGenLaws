        When jurors are to be drawn in a town, the town clerk and selectmen shall meet at the clerkâ€™s office or at some other public place appointed for the purpose, and, if the clerk is absent, the selectmen may proceed without him. The ballots in the jury box shall be shaken and mixed and one of the selectmen, without seeing the names written thereon, shall openly draw therefrom a number of ballots equal to the number of jurors required.
