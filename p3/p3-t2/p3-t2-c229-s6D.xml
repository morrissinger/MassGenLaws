        If an action is brought under section two B, or if the action is brought by the legal representatives under the preceding section or under section one of chapter one hundred and fifty-three, such action shall not fail by reason of the fact that it should have been brought under the other section, but at any time prior to final judgment may be so amended as to provide against such failure.
