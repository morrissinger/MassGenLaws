        The judgment debtor, if appearing, shall be examined on oath as to his or its property and ability to pay; provided, however, if the debtor is a corporation the person examined shall be its president, treasurer, cashier or other officer or agent in charge of the payment of debts, or if the debtor is a trust with transferable shares the person examined shall be any trustee or agent in charge of payment of debts; and such examination, if in writing, shall be signed and sworn to by the debtor if a natural person, or by the officer, trustee or agent in charge of payment of debts appearing in its behalf, if a corporation or trust with transferable shares, and filed with the court. Either party may introduce additional evidence, and if the debtor fails to appear at the examination and is a natural person, the examination may proceed and orders may be made in such debtorâ€™s absence. The examination may be oral or in writing, in the discretion of the court. The execution, or a certified copy thereof, shall be sufficient proof of the judgment.
