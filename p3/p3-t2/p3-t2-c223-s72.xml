        If goods are delivered to a carrier or other bailee by the owner or by a person whose act in conveying title to a purchaser in good faith for value would bind the owner and a negotiable document of title is issued for them, they cannot thereafter, while in the possession of such bailee, be attached by trustee process or otherwise, or be levied upon, unless the document be first surrendered to the bailee or its negotiation enjoined. The bailee shall not be compelled to deliver up the actual possession of the goods until the document is surrendered to him or impounded by the court.
