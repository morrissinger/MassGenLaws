        If the land levied upon cannot be divided without damage to the whole and is more than sufficient to satisfy the execution, the levy shall be made upon such undivided portion of the whole as will, in the opinion of the appraisers, satisfy the execution, and such undivided portion shall be held in common with the debtor.
