    <text>
        In civil proceedings which are not governed by the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff may, in reply to a defense alleged by the defendant, allege any facts which would in equity avoid such defense or which would entitle the plaintiff to be absolutely and unconditionally relieved in equity against such defense.
