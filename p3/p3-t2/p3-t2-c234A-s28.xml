    <text>
        The office of jury commissioner may cancel grand or trial juror service whenever it appears that the number of jurors scheduled to appear is in excess of the number reasonably required to conduct the business of the court without delay. The office of jury commissioner shall employ whatever means of notice, including telephone notice, that is appropriate under the circumstances. Any juror or standby juror whose service has been cancelled shall not be required to perform service at another time or place because of the cancellation, but such juror shall not be entitled to be disqualified under section four of this chapter if he should be randomly selected again within the succeeding three-year period.
