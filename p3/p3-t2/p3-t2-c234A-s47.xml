        The compensation and reimbursement policy of this chapter shall be to prevent financial hardship being imposed upon any juror because of performance of juror service insofar as possible. 
Where financial hardship exists, the court shall attempt to place the juror into the same financial position as such juror would have been were it not for the performance of juror service. The jury commissioner may issue regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, further defining rights and obligations of jurors and employers with respect to compensation and reimbursements to jurors during such service.
