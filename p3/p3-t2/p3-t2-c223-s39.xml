        In an action against a foreign insurance company transacting business in this commonwealth, service may be made upon an agent of the company, licensed as such in the commonwealth, who, having authority to issue policies and bind risks for the company, has issued the policy the liability on which is sought to be enforced, or an agent who lives or has his usual place of business in the county and has control over or superintendence of subordinate agents of the company, instead of on the commissioner of insurance under clause third of section one hundred and fifty-one of chapter one hundred and seventy-five.
