        A justice of the supreme judicial court, after a finding of facts by the court may report a case for determination by the full court or the appeals court. 
If a justice of the supreme judicial court is of the opinion that an interlocutory finding or order made by him so affects the merits of the controversy that the matter ought to be determined by the full court or the appeals court before any further proceedings in the trial court, he may report such matter to either court, and may stay all further proceedings except such as are necessary to preserve the rights of the parties. 
A justice of the supreme judicial court may, upon request of the parties, in any case where there is agreement as to all material facts, report the case to the full court or the appeals court without making any decision thereon.
