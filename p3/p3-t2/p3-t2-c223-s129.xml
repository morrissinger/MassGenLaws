        A defendant whose individual property has been attached in an action against several defendants may dissolve such attachment, or any part thereof, in any of the modes provided in the nine preceding sections. But the bond to dissolve such attachment shall be so conditioned as to apply only to a judgment recovered against such defendant alone or jointly.
