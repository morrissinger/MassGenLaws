        The court shall have the authority to excuse an employer from the duty to compensate a juror-employee or to excuse a self-employed juror from the duty to compensate himself for the first three days, or part thereof, of trial or grand juror service upon a finding that extreme financial hardship would be imposed upon the employer or self-employed juror if such duty were not removed. If an employer or self-employed juror is so excused, the court shall award reasonable compensation in lieu of wages to the juror to be paid by the commonwealth for the first three days, or part thereof, of juror service. Such award shall not exceed fifty dollars per day of trial or grand juror service. The hearing on the employerâ€™s extreme financial hardship shall occur no later than thirty days after the tender of the juror service certificate to the employer.
