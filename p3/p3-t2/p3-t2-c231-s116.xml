        Upon an appeal from a final judgment, the justice of the court by whom it was made may make such orders staying the enforcement of the judgment in an action for an injunction or appointment of a receiver as are needful for the protection of the rights of the parties, until the appeal shall be heard by the appellate court. Such order may be modified or vacated by the order of the appellate court, upon motion, after the appeal is taken.
