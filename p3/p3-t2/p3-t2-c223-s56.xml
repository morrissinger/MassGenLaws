        The officer who makes such later attachment shall not take the property itself, but he shall make proof of service of the writ of attachment to the court in writing, stating by whom the property was previously attached and shall leave a certified copy of the writ of attachment and of the proof of service of that writ of attachment with the former officer, if living, or, if he is dead, with his executor or administrator or whoever then has possession of the property. The attachment shall be considered as made when such copy is delivered in any of the modes provided in this section.
