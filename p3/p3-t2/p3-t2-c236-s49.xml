    <text>
        The right of redeeming land taken on execution may be taken and sold on another execution, in like manner as the right of redeeming mortgaged land may be taken and sold; and the debtor and those claiming under him may redeem the right sold under such second execution in like manner as if the right so sold had been a right of redeeming mortgaged land. All proceedings in levying such second execution, the redemption of the right sold under it and all the rights and obligations of the several parties relative to such levy and redemption shall be substantially the same as if the right taken and sold on such second execution had been a right of redeeming mortgaged land.
