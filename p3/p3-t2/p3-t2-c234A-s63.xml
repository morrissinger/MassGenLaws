        The office of jury commissioner, with the approval of the committee, may establish a sufficient number of telephone lines for the purposes of responding to juror inquiries, scheduling jurorsâ€™ terms of service, disseminating general information and standby information to jurors, and for use in snow emergencies, other public emergencies, and personal problems and emergencies of jurors. Automatic telephone answering devices may be used where appropriate. These information lines may be toll-free where justified by the volume of use and public convenience.
