        Land of a deceased person which has not been sold and conveyed, by deed duly recorded, by the executor or administrator of such deceased person under a license from the probate court or under a power of sale contained in the will of the deceased, may be taken on execution on a judgment against his executor or administrator for the debt of the deceased, for the costs of the action against him if the executor or administrator has not appeared therein, and for the fees and charges of the levy, and such land shall be appraised and set off or sold, in like manner as if execution had been levied against the deceased in his lifetime.
