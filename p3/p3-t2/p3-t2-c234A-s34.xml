        A trial juror shall have the right to one postponement of his term of juror service for not more than one year. The trial juror must exercise this right by duly completing and returning the juror confirmation form in which his election to postpone shall be indicated. The month and date, and an alternate month and date, to which the service is postponed shall be indicated in the confirmation form. The office of jury commissioner shall have authority to effectuate such first postponements. If the postponement date designated by a trial juror is improper, unavailable, or inconvenient for the court, the office of jury commissioner shall assign the alternate postponement date unless date is also improper, unavailable, or inconvenient in which case the office of jury commissioner shall assign a date of service which is reasonably close to the postponement date selected by the trial juror. The jury commissioner, with the approval of the jury management advisory committee, shall have discretionary authority to limit the numbers of postponements allowed each day in each courthouse in order to maintain the integrity of the demographic cross-sections appearing in the juror pools.
