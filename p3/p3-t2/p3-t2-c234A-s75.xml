        The use of data processing equipment, methods, services, forms, and electronic telecommunications systems by the office of jury commissioner for the implementation and administration of this chapter shall be specifically authorized. The office of jury commissioner may establish an on-line interactive data processing system in some or all of the participating counties. The office of jury commissioner, with the approval of the committee and with authorized approvals of representatives of the executive branch, may share in the use of the TELPAC telecommunications system of the commonwealth. The data processing center in the judicial branch, if possible, shall provide without cost to the office of jury commissioner such data processing capacity, file storage, and related services and supplies with highest priority access during regular business hours as shall be adequate for the orderly implementation and administration of this chapter in all participating counties. In the event the data processing center is unable to provide the aforementioned data processing services, the office of jury commissioner may, with the approval of the committee, procure these data processing services, in part or in full, from another governmental agency or from a private source, with or without the necessity for purchasing such services.
