        The deputy sheriff or constable shall, fourteen days at least before the time when the jurors are required to attend unless the court otherwise orders when issuing venires for additional jurors under section twelve, summon each person who is drawn, by reading to him the venire with the endorsement thereon of his having been drawn, or by leaving at his place of abode a written notice of his having been drawn and of the time and place of the sitting of the court at which he is required to attend, and shall make a return of the venire with his doings thereon to the clerk of the court, before the sitting of the court by which it was issued. After the service of such venire has been made, no person shall, except as otherwise provided by law, question any person so summoned for the purpose of obtaining information as to his background in connection with his jury duty.
