        The department may make such surveys and do such other work as may be required by any order of the land court, to reestablish and permanently mark certain triangulation points and stations previously established in connection with the topographical survey of the commonwealth, and the town boundary survey, which have been lost or destroyed, and to obtain the geographical position of such new points and stations as may be required from time to time by the court. The department may sell at such prices and on such conditions as it may prescribe maps prepared by it from time to time in connection with its functions under this chapter in respect to waterways and public lands.
