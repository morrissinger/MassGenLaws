        Samples of vinegar taken under authority of law shall be examined by the department of public health or by boards of health of towns. If it then appears that any sample is misbranded or adulterated, the department of public health, or the board of health of a town, as the case may be, need not cause formal complaint to be entered at once, but shall grant the opportunity for a hearing under section one hundred and eighty-nine.
