        No apprentice agreement shall be effective until approved by and registered with the division. An apprentice agreement shall be signed by the apprentice program sponsor and by the apprentice and, if the apprentice is a minor, by a legal guardian of the minor and by the deputy director. When a minor enters into an apprentice agreement for a period of training extending beyond the date upon which the apprentice shall attain his majority, the apprentice agreement, if approved and registered, shall be binding for the entire period referred to in the agreement, including so much thereof as may extend beyond the date upon which the apprentice attained majority.
