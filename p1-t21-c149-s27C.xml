    	     Any contractor or subcontractor convicted of willfully violating any provision of section 26, 27, 27A, 27B, 27F, 27G, 27H or 148B shall, in addition to any criminal penalty imposed, be prohibited from contracting, directly or indirectly, with the commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions for the construction of any public building or other public works, or from performing any work on the same as a contractor or subcontractor, for a period of five years from the date of such conviction. Any contractor or subcontractor convicted of violating any provision of section 26, 27, 27A, 27B, 27F, 27G, 27H or 148B shall, in addition to any criminal penalty imposed, be prohibited from contracting, directly or indirectly, with the commonwealth or any of its agencies, authorities or political subdivisions for the construction of any public building or other public works or from performing any work on the same as a contractor or subcontractor, for a period not to exceed six months from the date of such conviction for a first offense and up to three years from the date of conviction for subsequent offense. After final conviction and disposition of a violation pursuant to this paragraph in any court, the clerk of said court shall send a notice of such conviction to the attorney general, who shall publish written notice to all departments and agencies of the commonwealth which contract for public construction and to the appropriate authorities of counties, authorities, cities and towns that such person is prohibited from contracting, directly or indirectly, with the commonwealth or any of its authorities or political subdivisions for the period of time required under this paragraph. The attorney general may take such action as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this paragraph, and the superior court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin or invalidate any contract award made in violation of this paragraph.

    	     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum civil penalty that may be imposed upon any employer, contractor or subcontractor, who has not previously been either criminally convicted of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or chapter 151 or issued a citation hereunder, shall be no more than $15,000, except that in instances in which the attorney general determines that the employer, contractor or subcontractor lacked specific intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or said chapter 151, the maximum civil penalty for such an employer, contractor or subcontractor who has not previously been either criminally convicted of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or said chapter 151 or issued a citation hereunder shall be not more than $7,500. In determining the amount of any civil penalty to be assessed hereunder, said attorney general shall take into consideration previous violations of this chapter or said chapter 151 by the employer, the intent by such employer to violate the provisions of this chapter or said chapter 151, the number of employees affected by the present violation or violations, the monetary extent of the alleged violations, and the total monetary amount of the public contract or payroll involved.

    	     In the case of a citation for violating any provision of section 26, 27, 27A, 27B, 27F, 27G, 27H or 148B, the attorney general may also order that a bond in an amount necessary to rectify the infraction and to ensure compliance with sections 26 to 27H, inclusive, and with other provisions of law, be filed with said attorney general, conditioned upon payment of said rate or rates of wages, including payments to health and welfare funds and pension funds, or the equivalent payment in wages, on said public works to any person performing work within classifications as determined by the commissioner. Upon any failure to comply with the requirements set forth in a citation, said attorney general may order the cessation of all or the relevant portion of the work on the project site. In addition, any contractor or subcontractor failing to comply with the requirements set forth in a citation or order, shall be prohibited from contracting, directly or indirectly, with the commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions for the construction of any public building or other public works, or from performing any work on the same as a contractor or subcontractor, for a period of one year from the date of issuance of such citation or order. Any contractor or subcontractor who receives three citations or orders occurring on three different occasions, each of which includes a finding of intent, within a three year period shall automatically be debarred for a period of two years from the date of issuance of the third such citation or order or a final court order, whichever is later. Any debarment hereunder shall also apply to all affiliates of the contractor or subcontractor, as well as any successor company or corporation that said attorney general, upon investigation, determines to not have a true independent existence apart from that of the violating contractor or subcontractor.

    	     Any person aggrieved by any citation or order issued pursuant to this subsection may appeal said citation or order by filing a notice of appeal with the attorney general and the division of administrative law appeals within ten days of the receipt of the citation or order. Any such appellant shall be granted a hearing before the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with chapter 30A. The hearing officer may affirm or if the aggrieved person demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that the citation or order was erroneously issued, vacate, or modify the citation or order.

    	     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (6), if any civil penalty imposed by a citation or order issued by the attorney general remains unpaid beyond the time period specified for payment in said paragraph (6), such penalty amount and any restitution order, together with interest thereon at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, shall be a lien upon the real estate and personal property of the person who has failed to pay such penalty. Such lien shall take effect by operation of law on the day immediately following the due date for payment of such fine, and, unless dissolved by payment, shall as of said date be considered a tax due and owing to the commonwealth, which may be collected through the procedures provided for by chapter 62C. In addition to the foregoing, no officer of any corporation which has failed to pay any such penalty may incorporate or serve as an officer in any corporation which did not have a legal existence as of the date said fine became due and owing to the commonwealth.
