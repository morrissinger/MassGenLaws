The council shall submit an annual report to the city or town and shall send a copy thereof to the department of elder affairs. Said department shall from time to time review and evaluate such reports and make recommendations as to any required or needed changes in said local programs. The council may appoint such clerks and other employees as it may require. The names, addresses, telephone numbers, or other identifying information about elderly persons in the possession of the council shall not be public records, but the use of these records shall comply with sections 14 to 24, inclusive, of chapter 19A as a condition of receiving a government contract, program grant or other benefit, or as otherwise required by law.
