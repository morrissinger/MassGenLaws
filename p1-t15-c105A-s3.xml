        The operator of a self-service storage facility shall have a lien on all personal property stored within each leased space for rent, labor, insurance or other charges in relationship to the property and for expenses necessary for the preservation of the property or reasonably incurred in its sale pursuant to this chapter. 
An operator shall lose such lien on any goods which such operator voluntarily delivers or which he unjustifiably refuses to deliver. 
The rental agreement shall contain a statement, in bold type, advising the occupant: (a) that property stored in the leased space is not insured by the operator against loss or damage; (b) of the existence of the lien; and (c) that property stored in the leased space may be sold to satisfy the lien if the occupant is in default.
