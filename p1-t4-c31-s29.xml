        An appointing authority shall, prior to any request to the administrator for approval of a promotional appointment of a permanent employee in the labor service to a higher title in such service; or for approval of a change in employment of a permanent employee within such service from one position to a temporary or permanent position which is not higher but which has requirements for appointment which are substantially dissimilar to those of the position from which the change is being made, post a promotional bulletin. Such bulletin shall be posted for a period of at least five working days where it can be seen by all employees eligible for such promotional appointment or change in employment. Any such request shall contain a statement that the posting requirements have been satisfied, indicating the date and location of the posting. 
The promotional bulletin shall contain the following information about the position which is to be filled: the salary and location, any special qualifications or licenses which are required for performing the duties of the position, whether the position is permanent or temporary, if the position is temporary, the probable duration of the employment therein, and the last date to apply for the position. Such promotional bulletin shall be mailed to any employee who, during the entire period of posting, is on sick or military leave, on vacation or off the payroll. 
Within fourteen days after approval by the administrator of a promotional appointment in the labor service, the appointing authority shall post in all areas under its control where five or more civil service employees start their tour of duty, the following information about the person who has been promoted: name, permanent title, position to which the promotional appointment has been made and the date from which length of service was measured for purposes of determining seniority.
