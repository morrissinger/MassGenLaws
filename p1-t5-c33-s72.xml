        The commanding officer of a division, brigade, air wing or other separate commands may convene special courts-martial for his command, but such special courts-martial may in any case be convened by superior authority when by the latter deemed desirable. Special courts-martial shall have power to try any person subject to military law, except a commissioned officer, for any crime or offense made punishable by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or by the provisions of this chapter. Special courts-martial shall have the same powers of punishment as do general courts-martial, except that fines imposed by them shall not exceed one hundred dollars.
