    <text>
        A nurse anesthetist may issue written prescriptions and order tests and therapeutics for the immediate perioperative care of a patient pursuant to guidelines mutually developed and agreed upon by the nurse and the supervising physician in accordance with regulations promulgated jointly by the board and the board of registration in medicine after consultation with the board of registration in pharmacy. For the purposes of this section, the immediate perioperative care of a patient shall be defined as the period commencing on the day prior to surgery and ending upon discharge of the patient from post-anesthesia care. A prescription made by a nurse anesthetist shall include the name of the physician with whom such nurse developed and signed mutually agreed upon guidelines approved by the board and the board of registration in medicine under section 80B. The administration of anesthesia by a nurse anesthetist directly to a patient shall not require a written prescription.
