No person shall so dispose of dredged material except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of such a permit. Any violation of any provision of this section or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, (a) shall be punishable by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars for each day that such violation occurs or continues, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment; or (b) shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars for each day that such violation occurs or continues.
