        Upon failure to file a statement, report or affidavit within 10 days after receiving notice under section 28, the city or town clerk, as the case may be, shall notify the director thereof and shall furnish him with copies of all papers related thereto and the director, if satisfied there is cause, shall assess a penalty and may refer the person or committee to the attorney general pursuant to section 3. If any statement filed with the city or town clerk, as the case may be, discloses any violation of this chapter, such city or town clerk shall notify the director thereof and shall furnish him with copies of all papers relating thereto. The director shall examine every such case referred to him by such clerk and may refer such cases to the attorney general in accordance with section 3. If satisfied that there is cause, the attorney general shall, in the name of the commonwealth, institute appropriate criminal or civil proceedings or refer the case to the proper district attorney for such actions as may be appropriate. Any city or town clerk shall at any time upon the request of the attorney general or the director forward any evidence or information received by such clerk to the attorney general or director for whatever action the attorney general or director deems appropriate pursuant to law.
