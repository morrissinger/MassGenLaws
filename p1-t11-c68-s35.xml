        Any person who solicits contributions from the public by door-to-door visitation or in person for any charitable, civic or political cause or purpose, and who receives for such solicitation a wage, salary, percentage of the donations received, or other contractual remuneration or thing of value, but not to include reimbursements for expenses incurred in soliciting, shall inform each person so solicited that the solicitation is a paid solicitation. Such information shall be so provided in writing or in the form of a clearly displayed badge or sign bearing the words “Paid Solicitor”. Any person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine of one hundred dollars for each such violation. 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to the finance chairman, accountant, treasurer or auditor of any organization, trust committee, foundation, group, association, partnership, corporation, society, or any combination thereof; provided, however, that such financial officer is not directly soliciting; nor shall such provisions apply to any ordained clergyman, minister, priest, rabbi, officer or any duly authorized member of any religious order or any other tax exempt religious organization.
