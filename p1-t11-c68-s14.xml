        The probate court for the county where a town is situated, to which funds have been so given or bequeathed, may, upon the petition of five persons, cite all parties interested to appear before it to answer all complaints which may then and there be made; and if a trustee neglects or refuses to render such annual exhibit, or is incapable of discharging the trust reposed in him, or unsuitable to manage the affairs of the same, the court may remove him and fill the vacancy.
