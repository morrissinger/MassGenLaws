    <text>
        Any person hospitalized at the treatment center may petition the district court which committed him to release him therefrom. Such petition shall not be made until six months after the original court commitment. If such petition is denied, another such petition shall not be filed until six months after the date of denial of a previous petition. 
The court may order the person released from the treatment center if it finds such person is no longer affected with active tuberculosis, or is willing and able to accept proper medical treatment, and is thereby no longer a danger to the public health.
