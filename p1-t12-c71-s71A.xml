    <text>
        A school committee may, subject, however, to all other provisions of law, designate the locations for the erection of highway safety stations for children awaiting a school bus; provided, that such locations have been approved by the school superintendent or, as his designee, the school transportation officer. A school committee may order the discontinuance of the use of any such station by the children if it is not constructed of durable material with a floor of concrete raised above ground level, or is not kept clean, well painted, free of snow, and suitably maintained at all times.
