        The department shall establish and implement procedures for the making, transmission and investigation of complaints concerning any person certified, licensed, designated or otherwise approved by the department under this chapter. The department shall prepare, and make available upon request, a description of such procedures, and it shall, as the public interest may require, investigate every complaint received, except to the extent that the act or practice complained of does not constitute a violation of this chapter or any regulation, guideline or order under this chapter. The department shall refer complaints to other agencies and organizations, as appropriate. Upon investigation the department shall notify the complainant, if known, of its action in the matter. If it finds that an investigation is not required, it shall notify the complainant, if known, of its finding and with its reason.
