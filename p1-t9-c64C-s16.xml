        Any retailer or wholesaler may advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes at a price made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor who is selling the same article at cost to him as a wholesaler or retailer. The prices of cigarettes advertised, offered for sale or sold under the exemptions specified in section fifteen shall not be considered the price of a competitor and used as a basis for establishing prices below cost, nor shall prices established at bankrupt sales be considered as prices of a competitor within the purview of the first sentence of this section.
