        A claimant whose claim is not allowed as aforesaid, and the person complained against, shall each have the same right of appeal to the superior court as if he had been convicted of crime; but before his appeal is allowed he shall recognize to the commonwealth in the sum of two hundred dollars, with sufficient surety or sureties, to prosecute his appeal to the superior court and to abide the sentence of the court thereon. Upon such appeal, any question of fact shall be tried by a jury. On the judgment of the court after verdict, whether a forfeiture of the whole or any part of the alcoholic beverages and vessels seized, or otherwise, similar proceedings shall be had as are directed in the five preceding sections.
