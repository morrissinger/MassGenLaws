        Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, each board of trustees shall have the authority to make any purchase or purchases in the amount of two thousand dollars or less, and to purchase without limitation of amount library books and periodicals, educational and scientific supplies and equipment, printing and binding, emergency repairs and replacement parts, and perishable items, without recourse to any other state board, bureau, department or commission; provided, however, that in so doing the college shall follow modern methods of purchasing and shall, wherever practicable, invite competitive bids. Except as herein provided, the state purchasing agent shall on the certification of availability of funds purchase all items specified on requisitions submitted to him by any such board of trustees; provided, that the board of trustees shall have the right to review all bids received on any said board’s requisitions and to make binding recommendations on the award of the contract based on the judgment of the board as to which of the bids best meet said board’s specification on which the bids were received. Products assembled, manufactured or otherwise produced by the Massachusetts commission for the blind shall be purchased from the commission pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred and thirty-four of chapter six.
