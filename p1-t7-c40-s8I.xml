        A city or town which accepts this section may establish an energy resources commission, hereinafter called the commission, for the promotion and development of the energy resources of said city or town. Such commission shall: (1) develop and administer programs relating to energy conservation, nonrenewable energy supply and resource development, recycling, energy information, emergency heating assistance, and energy emergencies; (2) advise, assist, and cooperate with state, regional, and federal agencies in developing appropriate programs and policies relating to energy planning and regulation in the commonwealth including assistance and advice in the preparation of loan or grant applications with respect to energy programs for local agencies; (3) develop local energy data and information management capabilities to aid energy planning and decision-making; (4) promote the development of sound local energy education programs; (5) with the approval of the city or town, apply for, receive, expend, represent and act on behalf of the city or town in connection with federal grants, grant programs or reimbursements, or private grants, keep accounts, records, personal data, enter into contracts, and adjust claims; (6) accept gifts, grants, bequests, and devises, whether real or personal, from any source, whether public or private, for the purpose of assisting the commission in the discharge of its duties; (7) subject to appropriation, acquire real or personal property; (8) promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out their statutory responsibilities; (9) seek to coordinate the activities of governmental or unofficial bodies organized for similar purposes, and may advertise, prepare, print and distribute books, maps, charts, plans and pamphlets which in its judgment it deems necessary for its work and it shall keep an index of all energy resources within such city or town with the objective of obtaining information pertinent to proper utilization of such resources; (10) it shall keep accurate records of its meetings and actions and shall file an annual report which shall be printed in the case of towns in the annual town report. The commission may, subject to appropriation, appoint such clerks and other employees as it may from time to time require. The commission shall consist of not less than three nor more than seven members. In cities the members shall be appointed by the mayor, subject to the provisions of the city charter, except that in cities having or operating under a Plan D or Plan E form of city charter, said appointments shall be by the city manager, subject to the provisions of the charter; and in towns the members shall be appointed by the selectmen, except that in towns having a manager form of government appointments shall be made by the town manager, subject to the approval of the selectmen. In any city or town which has not accepted the provisions of section eight H, the energy resources commission may assume the powers and duties of a recycling commission. 
When a commission is established, the initial terms of the members shall be for one, two or three years, and so arranged that the terms of approximately one-third of the members will expire each year, and their successors shall be appointed for terms of three years each. 
Any member of a commission so appointed may, after a public hearing, if requested, be removed for cause by the appointing authority. A vacancy occurring otherwise than by expiration of a term shall, in a city, be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as an original appointment, and, in a town, in the manner provided in section eleven of chapter forty-one.
