The department of revenue shall be responsible for providing estimates of receipts and the office of the comptroller for providing estimates of agency spending and non-tax revenue receipts.  The executive office for administration and finance and the treasurer's office shall jointly develop and approve annual and quarterly cash management plans to address gaps identified by cash flow projections and variance reports. Said management plans shall clearly identify the roles to be played by short-term borrowing, investment policy, expenditure controls, and revenue management in providing necessary cash.  The state treasurer shall semi-annually report to the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on revenue the lending and banking institutions into which the cash deposits of the commonwealth are being deposited.
