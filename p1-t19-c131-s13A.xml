        Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall fish, trap, or hunt in the commonwealth without first having obtained a wildlands conservation stamp, which shall be issued by the director or his duly authorized agent upon the payment of five dollars; provided, however, that persons who are exempted from licensing requirements need not purchase such a stamp; provided, further, that persons issued fishing, sporting, trapping, or hunting licenses without charge shall be issued said stamp without charge; and provided, further, that no person who has purchased a stamp with any current resident license to fish, trap, or hunt shall be required to pay the fee for a wildlands conservation stamp for any additional current license or any duplicate license. The director is hereby authorized to issue stamps in such form as he may prescribe and may issue rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this section. The stamp may be imprinted directly on fishing, sporting, trapping, or hunting licenses or issued separately at the discretion of the director.
