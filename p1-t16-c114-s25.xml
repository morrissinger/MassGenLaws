        A town in which cemetery commissioners are chosen may receive gifts or bequests for maintaining cemeteries or cemetery lots, which shall be paid into the town treasury and, with the accounts thereof, shall be kept separate from the other money and accounts of said town. The town treasurer shall invest all such funds in accordance with the stipulations, if any, accompanying them; otherwise he shall invest them as ordered by said commissioners and pay the income therefrom upon their order or with their approval. The proceeds of sales of lots or rights of burial in such cemeteries shall be paid into the town treasury and be appropriated to reimburse the town for the cost of the land, its care, improvement and embellishment, or the enlargement of the cemetery.
