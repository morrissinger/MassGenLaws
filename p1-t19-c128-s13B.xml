    <order_by>13B</order_by>
    <text>
        The dealer of milk in the commonwealth who first received milk from Massachusetts producers, shall pay on or before the due date of payment to the producers, the amount of 5 cents per 100 weight on the volume of all the milk purchased from the producers and the payments shall be deposited with the state treasurer in the Milk Producers Security Fund established by section 48 of chapter 10. Payment as provided in this section shall be made for all milk shipped to a dealer by a producer who is not a member of a cooperative association which guarantees payment where there is a default in the payment for milk. Payment shall be deducted by the dealer from monies owed by the dealer to the producers in the amount of 5 cents per 100 weight. 
The commissioner may suspend the requirements of the previous paragraph from time to time for such a length of time he considers necessary, but not exceeding 2 years, upon determination that the interests of the producers would be best served by a suspension. The commissioner shall not suspend these requirements if the balance of the fund does not exceed $1,000,000. The commissioner shall provide 30 daysâ€™ written notice of any suspension or reinstatement of payments into the fund to the house and senate committees on ways and means and to all dealers and producers affected.
