    <text>
        If the applicant for a permit to use an explosive in the blasting of rock or any other substance desires to conduct blasting operations in more than one city or town in the commonwealth he may, instead of filing a bond with the clerk of each city or town in which such operations are to be conducted, file a bond with the state treasurer in the penal sum of twenty thousand dollars, running to the commonwealth, with sureties approved by the state treasurer, and for such additional penal sum as the marshal shall determine to be necessary to cover the losses, damages or injuries that might ensue to persons or property by reason thereof. The provisions of sections nineteen and twenty shall apply to said bond and actions thereon so far as applicable.
