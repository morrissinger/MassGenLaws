        The secretary shall monitor the implementation of regulations relative to climate change and shall, every 5 years, publish a report which shall include recommendations regarding such implementation. The report shall include, without limitation: (i) whether regulations or other measures undertaken, including distribution of emissions allowances, are equitable and minimize costs and maximize the total benefits to the commonwealth and encourage early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) whether activities undertaken to comply with state regulations and efforts disproportionately impact low-income communities; (iii) whether entities that have voluntarily reduced their greenhouse gas emissions prior to the implementation of this chapter receive appropriate credit for early voluntary reductions; (iv) whether activities undertaken pursuant to the regulations complement, and do not interfere with, efforts to achieve and maintain federal and state ambient air quality standards and reduce toxic air contaminant emissions; (v) consider overall societal benefits, including reductions in other air pollutants, diversification of energy sources and other benefits to the economy, environment and public health; (vi) whether state actions minimize the administrative burden of implementing and complying with these regulations; (vii) whether state actions minimize leakage; (viii) consider the significance of the contribution of each source or category of sources to statewide emissions of greenhouse gases; (ix) whether greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved are real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable and enforceable; and (x) recommendations for future policy action. The report shall be filed with the clerk of the house of representatives, the clerk of the senate, the chairs of the house and senate committees on ways and means, the chairs of the joint committee of telecommunications, utilities and energy and the chairs of the joint committee on the environment, natural resources and agriculture.
