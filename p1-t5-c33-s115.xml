        Any unit of the military forces of the commonwealth may own personal property, to be under the control of the active members thereof; and the commanding officer of any such unit may recover in his own name for its use, in any county where such unit or part thereof is located, any debts or effects belonging to it, or damages for injury to such property. No suit pending in his name shall be abated by his ceasing to be commanding officer of the unit; but his successor shall be admitted to prosecute the suit.
