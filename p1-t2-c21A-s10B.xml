        It shall be the duty of the office of law enforcement to enforce all penal laws which it is the duty of any agency within the executive office of environmental affairs to enforce, the General Laws or any special laws to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed as divesting other officers or employees of the commonwealth of the duty to enforce laws as provided for in the General Laws or any special laws. It shall also direct all inspections, claims and investigations. All police agencies shall at once notify the office of law enforcement or an environmental police officer thereof of a person presumed to be lost in any of the woodlands of the commonwealth.
