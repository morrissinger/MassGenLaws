        The governor shall annually issue a proclamation setting apart May first as Loyalty Day and recommending that it be observed by the people with appropriate exercises in the schools and otherwise, in recognition of the manifold blessings of freedom and liberty secured to the people of the United States by their constitutional form of government and preserved and maintained by the unselfish service and sacrifice of her people, to the end that we, mindful of the priceless heritage that has been handed down to us, may be ever vigilant against subversive movements calculated to undermine our American form of government, and may embrace this occasion to strengthen our sentiments of faith and loyalty to our country.
