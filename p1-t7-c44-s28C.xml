    	     Any city or town is hereby authorized pursuant to a two-thirds vote, from time to time to issue its debt obligations pursuant to this section to pay project costs of (1) cleaning up or preventing pollution caused by existing or closed landfills or other solid waste disposal facilities including clean up or prevention activities taken pursuant to chapter twenty-one E or chapter twenty-one H; (2) constructing incinerators, refuse transfer facilities, recycling facilities, composting facilities, resource recovery facilities or other solid waste disposal facilities, for the purpose of disposing of waste, refuse and garbage; (3) remodeling, reconstructing or making extraordinary repairs to incinerators, refuse transfer facilities, recycling facilities, resource recovery facilities or other solid waste disposal facilities, owned by the city or town and used for the purpose of disposing of waste, refuse and garbage; and (4) closing out a landfill area, opening a new landfill area, or making improvements to an existing landfill area. No indebtedness shall be incurred hereunder until plans relating to the project shall have been submitted to the department of environmental protection and the approval of said department has been granted therefor.

    	     The chief executive officer of any city or town is hereby authorized and empowered in connection with any borrowing under this section to enter into one or more trust or security agreements between such city or town and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the commonwealth, or directly between such city or town and the lenders on the debt obligations, necessary to effectuate and to secure such borrowing. Such agreements may pledge or assign, and create a security interest in, in whole or in part, the revenues and other money held or to be received by the city or town from any project being financed or from any fees or charges imposed by such city or town relating to solid waste disposal and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the city or town and the proceeds thereof. Such agreements may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security and remedies of the holders of such debt obligations as may be reasonable and not in violation of law, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event thereof, which may include the acceleration of maturities and covenants setting forth the duties of, and limitations on, the city or town in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, equipping, furnishing, maintenance, use, operation, repair, insurance and disposition of the project being financed by such debt obligations, the custody, safeguarding, investment and application of money, the issuance of additional debt obligations, the fixing, revision and collection of fees or other charges relating to solid waste disposal, the use of any surplus proceeds of the borrowing, including any investment earnings thereon, the establishment of special funds and reserves and the making and amending of contracts relating to such project.

    	     In addition to authority otherwise granted by law, a city or town may, when authorized by a two-thirds vote, issue refunding debt obligations for the purpose of paying any of its debt obligations issued under this section prior to maturity or upon acceleration of redemption. Refunding debt obligations may be issued at such times prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded debt obligations as the treasurer and chief executive officer deem to be in the best interest of the city or town. The refunding debt obligations may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide for the principal of the debt obligations being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such debt obligations, the costs of issuance of the refunding debt obligations, the costs of redeeming the debt obligations being refunded and such reserves as may be required by any agreement securing the refunding debt obligations. The issue of refunding debt obligations, the maturity or maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, and the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties and obligations of the city or town in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this section relating to the issue of debt obligations other than refunding debt obligations insofar as the same may be applicable; provided, however, that the refunding debt obligations shall be payable no later than the last date on which any portion of the debt obligations being refunded are payable or within the remaining useful life of the work or purpose financed by the refunded debt obligations, as determined by the chief executive officer, whichever is later. The provisions of section twenty-one A of chapter forty-four shall not apply to any such refunding debt obligations.

    	     Any city or town acting by and through the officer or officers, board, committee or other body authorized by law, if any, to fix, revise, charge and collect such fees and other charges, otherwise, acting by and through its chief executive officer, is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge and collect fees and other charges for any facilities or services provided by such city or town as relate to the collection or disposal of solid waste. If a city or town has issued debt obligations under this section, the fees and other charges established as aforesaid shall be fixed and adjusted during any period when such debt obligations are outstanding so as to provide revenues at least sufficient (i) to pay the current expenses of operating and maintaining such facilities and services, (ii) to pay the principal or, premium, if any, and interest on all debt obligations issued by the city or town under this section as the same become due and payable, (iii) to create and maintain such reserves as may be required by a resolution or agreement relating to the issuance of debt obligations hereunder, (iv) to provide funds for paying project costs and maintenance, repair, replacement and renewal costs related to any project financed with debt obligations issued hereunder and (v) to pay or provide for any and all amounts which the city or town may be obligated to pay by law or contract relating to such project. In addition such fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted so as to provide revenues sufficient to pay any costs incurred by the city or town to clean up or prevent pollution caused by existing active or inactive landfills or other solid waste disposal facilities, including the operation and maintenance of such facilities, or to provide solid waste disposal facilities, including but not limited to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on debt of the city or town issued pursuant to section seven or eight, and to provide funds for the estimated cost of closing any existing operating solid waste facility, which revenue and funds shall be held by the city or town in a separate fund or funds for subsequent appropriation for such purpose. Except as otherwise provided above, such fees and charges may be fixed and adjusted by each city or town to cover all or any part of the costs specified above. Cities and towns may collect and enforce by legal proceedings such fees and charges from persons liable therefor and in connection with such collection and enforcement cities and towns may employ all the powers and privileges granted to them by law with respect to any similar fee or other charge including but not limited to the powers and privileges granted cities and towns under the provisions of sections forty-two A to forty-two F, inclusive, of chapter forty and sections sixteen to sixteen F, inclusive, of chapter eighty-three.

    	     In addition to any other power conferred by law, a city or town may from time to time contract for the operation by others of any solid waste facility or facilities financed or to be financed by such city or town in whole or in part under this section or any other general or special law or may from time to time lease the same to others for operation by them and may contract with any such operator for the disposal of refuse, garbage and waste, or for any of the foregoing, or for the purchase or use of by-products or residue resulting from the operation of such facilities. All other cities, towns and other public agencies and private parties are also authorized from time to time to contract with such city or town or with any such operator for the disposal of refuse, garbage and waste, or for any of the foregoing, or from the purchase or use of by-products or residue resulting from the operation of such facilities. Such contracts may be for such periods as agreed upon by the parties and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may include provisions for the delivery of minimum amounts of refuse, garbage and waste and payments for the use of the facilities to be based thereon; provided, however, that such provisions do not result in the imposition of a contract penalty for municipal participation in a commonwealth approved program of residential source separation of recyclable materials, for unit prices, which may be graduated, and for adjustments thereof. Such contracts may also include provisions for the payment or performance of obligations imposed on cities, towns or other public agencies notwithstanding the interruption, curtailment or abandonment of construction or operation of the facilities; provided, however, that it shall be contrary to public policy to enforce such obligations against a city, town or other public agency unless notice of an operating permit granted by the department of environmental protection for the facility shall have been recorded as provided in section one hundred and fifty A of chapter one hundred and eleven, and the interruption, curtailment or abandonment is attributable to circumstances which are beyond the control of the contractor or operator of the facilities and which render it physically or commercially impracticable or legally impermissible to operate the facilities even if the facilities conformed to the operating plans and specifications for which said operating permit was recorded. Such payments, unit prices or adjustments need not be specifically stated in said contract but may be determined by formulae if set forth therein. In addition, supplementary charges, or adjustments, may be imposed by the facility upon cities and towns in payment for increases in costs or decreases in revenues, incurred, or projected to be incurred, by the facility as the result of changes in state or federal laws and regulations directly affecting the operations of the facility. Any such supplementary charge or adjustment shall include documentation which provides a detailed statement accounting for the causes of any increases in costs, or losses of revenues, for which by the terms of the contract a supplementary charge or adjustment may be made, documents prepared by qualified accountants which set forth the assumptions, formulas and calculations used in computing the amount of the supplementary charge or adjustment, and an accounting of the supplementary charge or adjustment being imposed and an evaluation as to whether they are allowable under the terms of the contract and as to whether they have been correctly calculated. At the end of each fiscal year, the facility shall document the actual increases in cost, or decreases in revenues, and the actual amount of additional fees received by the facility during the past year, and determine if the actual increased costs or decreased revenues are at variance with the revenues and expenditures estimated and used to establish the amount of any approved supplementary charge or adjustment. The supplementary charge or adjustment shall be recalculated using the actual figures and the fees for the succeeding year shall reflect the appropriate amounts to be either refunded to or recouped from the cities and towns. Any dispute between a city or town and a facility regarding the imposition of such supplementary charge or adjustment shall be resolved by arbitration at the request of either party. Both parties shall provide all necessary data to assist the arbitrator or arbitration panel in its determination. The findings of the arbitrator or the arbitration panel shall be binding upon the facility and the city or town.

    	     The provisions of subsection (c) may be used by a city or town as appropriate in connection with general debt obligations of the city or town issued pursuant to other general or special laws for solid waste disposal purposes as well as in connection with debt obligations issued under this section. The provisions of subsections (f) and (g) are applicable to any city or town whether or not any such city or town has issued debt obligations under this section or under any other provision of law for solid waste disposal purposes.
