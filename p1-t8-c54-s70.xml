When the polls are closed, the presiding officer shall cause a police officer or other qualified person to be stationed at the end of the line of persons waiting to vote to see that no other persons vote than those who were in the polling place or in line at the door at the time fixed for closing the polls. After the last voter in line at the door has entered within the guard rail, the voters shall be allowed five minutes in which to cast their votes.
