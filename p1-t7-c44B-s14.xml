        Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, every city and town may accept sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and may thereupon receive state grants under section 10. A city or town that accepts said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, shall not be precluded from participating in state grant programs. 
State grant programs may include local adoption of this chapter among the criteria for selection of grant recipients. Funds in the Community Preservation Fund may be made available and used by the city or town as the local share for state or federal grants upon recommendation of the community preservation committee and the legislative body, as provided for in section 5, if such grants and such local share are used in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the community preservation committee.
