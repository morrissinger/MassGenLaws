        If the full board sitting at such hearing finds the person guilty, the board may suspend the effect of his certificate of registration as a pharmacist for such term as it fixes. The board may at any time reconsider its action in cases where it has suspended or revoked the license or certificate of registration of a pharmacist, and may change its determination as justice shall require.
