        It is the intent of this chapter that there be established for each fiscal year a state tax revenue growth limit calculated on the basis of the level of growth in total wages and salaries of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Further, although not specifically required by anything contained in this chapter, it is assumed that from allowable state tax revenues as defined herein the Commonwealth will give priority attention to the funding of state financial assistance to local governmental units, obligations under the state governmental pension systems, and payment of principal and interest on debt and other obligations of the Commonwealth. Any other provisions of the general or special laws of the Commonwealth notwithstanding, the following provisions shall be effective.
