For the purposes of this section, the amount of estimated tax shall be the amount which the taxpayer estimates as the tax due under chapter sixty-two with respect to the taxable year reduced by the total amount of the credits allowed under section 6 of chapter 62 to which the taxpayer estimates he will be entitled and further reduced by the amount which the taxpayer estimates as the credits to which he will be entitled under section nine for taxes withheld during the taxable year.
