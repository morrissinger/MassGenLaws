        If, within thirty days after such notice, such holder of the tax title does not comply therewith, the collector shall cause a copy thereof, with an affidavit by himself or by a disinterested person of the service thereof and of the facts in the case, to be recorded in the registry of deeds. A note of reference to the record of said copy shall be made on the margin of the record of the collectorâ€™s deed therein referred to; and from the time of such record the interest payable by reason of a breach of warranty in such deed shall cease, and all right and title acquired under such deed shall be held to be released. The collector shall give notice of such proceedings to the town treasurer, who shall, on reasonable demand, pay over out of any funds in his hands the amount due in respect of said deed to the person entitled thereto.
