See 2012, 106, Sec. 9.]  As used in this chapter the term "private business school'' shall mean a school maintained or classes conducted, for profit or by charging tuition, for the purpose of teaching business administration, accounting, data processing, computer operation, preparation for civil service examinations, secretarial skills, sales techniques or social skills, habits or customs, tractor-trailer operating skills, and all health and allied health related occupational skills, and any other private business school not regulated by any agency of the commonwealth. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any schools giving instruction in health and allied health related occupational skills if such schools are licensed by any agency of the commonwealth.
