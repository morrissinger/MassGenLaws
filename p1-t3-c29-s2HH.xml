        [ Text of section effective until January 1, 2013. Repealed by 2012, 165, Sec. 112. See 2012, 165, Sec. 137.]  There is hereby established upon the books of the commonwealth a separate fund to be known as the Federal Facilities Reserve Fund. There shall be credited to said fund all revenues resulting from the development leasing, operation, granting of concessions or other use of the selected site and its facilities or agreements related thereto including, without limitation, grants, fees, compensation, payments or revenues of any kind from any agency of the federal government or any other governmental entity.  Amounts credited to said fund shall be available, subject to appropriation, for planning and studies, acquisition of land and buildings and interest therein, the preparation of plans and specifications, the development, construction, reconstruction, improvement, renovation, enlargement, expansion, remodeling, build-out, repair, furnishings and equipment, or management, operation or maintenance of the selected site and its facilities and any administration costs associated therewith; provided, however, that said funds shall not be used for management, operation or maintenance unless the commissioner determines that adequate reserves necessary to meet the foreseeable capital needs of the selected site and its facilities will be available in said Fund despite such use.
