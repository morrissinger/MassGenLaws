        If a person refuses or neglects to repair or rebuild the part of a partition fence which under this chapter he is required to maintain, any person aggrieved may complain to the fence viewers, who, after notice to each party, shall view the fence; and if they determine that it is insufficient and that a partition fence is required, they shall so state in writing to the delinquent occupant, and direct him to repair or rebuild his part within such time as the fence viewers may determine; and if the fence is not so repaired or rebuilt, the complainant, after having repaired or rebuilt his part of said fence, may repair or rebuild the part of such occupant.
