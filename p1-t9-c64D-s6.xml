        The commissioner shall administer and enforce the taxes imposed by this chapter. At any time after the making of a conveyance or transfer subject to the excise imposed by this chapter, he may investigate and ascertain whether said excise, in the proper amount, was paid. For this purpose, the commissioner may examine any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the amount of excise payable, and may enforce by mandamus his right to such examination. Whoever refuses to permit the commissioner, or any of his agents or representatives, to inspect such books, papers, records or memoranda, or fails to preserve the same for two years, or alters, cancels or obliterates any part thereof, or makes any false entry therein, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than two years, or both.
