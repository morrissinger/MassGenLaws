        The director of professional licensure shall determine the renewal cycle and renewal period for all licenses issued by the board. Persons licensed in accordance with these sections shall apply to the board for renewal of their licenses on or before the expiration date, as determined by the director, unless such license was earlier revoked, suspended or canceled as a result of a disciplinary proceeding instituted pursuant to this chapter. Applications for renewal shall be made on forms approved by the board and accompanied by payment of a renewal fee, as determined by the secretary of administration pursuant to section 3B of chapter 7. All licensing and application fees and civil administrative penalties collected pursuant to sections 237 to 250, inclusive, of chapter 112, shall be deposited into the trust fund established in section 35V of chapter 10.
