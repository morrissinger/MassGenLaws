        Every minor between sixteen and eighteen who does not meet the requirements for the completion of the sixth grade of the public schools of the town where the minor resides shall, except as otherwise provided herein, attend some public evening school, if any, in the town of the minor’s residence, for the whole time during which the public evening schools are in session, unless the minor attends a public day school, or a private school approved as provided in section one by the school committee, or unless the minor’s physical or mental condition is such as to render the minor’s attendance harmful or impractical. Any such minor may, with the consent of the school committee of the town in which the minor resides, attend a public evening school in the town where the minor is employed, upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the school committees of such towns. Wilful violations of this section by such a minor shall be punished by a fine of not less than five dollars; failure for six sessions within a period of one month by any person in control of such a minor to cause the minor’s attendance shall, on complaint by a supervisor of attendance, be punished by a fine of not more than twenty dollars.
