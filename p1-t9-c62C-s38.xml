        No tax assessed on any person liable to taxation shall be abated unless the person assessed shall have filed, at or before the time of bringing his application for abatement, a return as required by this chapter for the period to which his application relates; and if he filed a fraudulent return, or having filed an incorrect or insufficient return, has failed, after notice, to file a proper return, the commissioner shall not abate the tax below double the amount for which the person assessed was properly taxable under this chapter.
