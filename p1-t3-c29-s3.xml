The said estimates shall not include any estimate for any new or special purpose or object not authorized by statute.  Copies of all such statements, recommendations, and estimates as they pertain to space rentals and maintenance and construction or repair of capital facilities shall be submitted on or before the aforementioned date to the commissioner of capital asset management and maintenance.
