Notice of the adoption of such order shall be sent forthwith by registered mail to every person, whose address is known, appearing of record to have an interest in any land to be taken, damaged or assessed, by or on account of the proposed improvement, setting forth all estimates contained in said order in relation to said land, and a like notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on each parcel thereof.
