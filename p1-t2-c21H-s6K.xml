    	     No person shall sell a mercury-added product unless the product is labeled by the manufacturer pursuant to this section. The label, constructed of materials that are sufficiently durable to remain legible for the useful life of the product, shall clearly inform the purchaser that mercury is present in the product and that the product shall be reused, recycled or properly disposed of as hazardous waste. Manufacturers of products that contain an irremovable mercury-containing lamp used for backlighting shall meet the product labeling requirements of this section by placing the label on the product or its care and use manual.
