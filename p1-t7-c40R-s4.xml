    	     Upon application by a city or town, the department shall make a preliminary determination, before the city or town votes on a proposed smart growth zoning ordinance or bylaw, whether the district would be eligible for the financial incentives and the priorities for state expenditures set forth in section 9. The departmentâ€™s determination shall be communicated to the city or town in a letter of eligibility. If the department denies the application, it shall inform the applicant of the deficiencies in its submission. A city or town may re-apply for approval after addressing any deficiencies in a prior application. If the department does not act upon a complete and approvable application within 60 days of receipt, the application shall be deemed approved.
