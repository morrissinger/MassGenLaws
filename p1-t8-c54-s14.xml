        If there is a vacancy in the number of election officers, or if an election officer declines his appointment and gives notice thereof to the city or town clerk within ten days following the date of his appointment, the mayor or the selectmen shall, except as provided in section sixteen, fill the vacancy; and, if the party representation requirements of section thirteen apply, the appointment shall be so made as to preserve the equal representation of the two leading political parties. Appointments to fill vacancies shall not be subject to confirmation by the aldermen, any provision of general or special law to the contrary notwithstanding.
