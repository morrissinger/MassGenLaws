        Upon retirement, a judge shall be paid an amount equal to the vacation allowance as earned in the vacation year prior to such retirement; provided, however, that no monetary or other allowance has already been awarded for such vacation allowance. 
Upon retirement, a judge who has accrued unused sick leave credit shall be paid an amount equal to twenty percent of the value of such credit as determined by the rate of compensation received at the time of retirement; provided, however, that such payment for accrued unused sick leave shall not affect the amount of retirement allowance available to such judge.
