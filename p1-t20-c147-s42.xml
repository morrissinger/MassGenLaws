        Any license may be revoked or suspended by the commission for a violation of any provision of sections thirty-two to forty-seven, inclusive, or of any other law of the commonwealth or of any rule or regulation adopted by the commission or whenever the licensee has, in the judgment of the commission, been guilty of any act or offense detrimental to the public interest. 
The commission may suspend a license of a combatant issued under section 35 without a hearing upon a finding that it would be unsafe for the individual to compete until either the passing of a fixed period of time or upon medical clearance. The commission may assess an administrative penalty not to exceed $2,000 for each violation of sections 32 to 45, inclusive, or the commissionâ€™s rules and regulations committed by an individual required to be licensed under this chapter.
