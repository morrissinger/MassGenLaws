        In order to extend to employees of instrumentalities, and to the dependents and survivors of such employees, the basic protection accorded to others by the old age and survivors insurance system embodied in the Social Security Act, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the general court, subject to the limitations of this chapter, that such steps be taken as to provide such protection to employees of instrumentalities on as broad a basis as is permitted under the Social Security Act.
