        Prior to issuing a license under section 6, the department may conduct an inspection of EMS vehicles to be listed in such license. Each person to whom a license is issued shall be entitled to a certificate of inspection for each such EMS vehicle upon proof that the EMS vehicle is in compliance with such requirements as the department may establish by regulation for a certificate of inspection. Each certificate shall be valid only for the vehicle for which it is issued and to the service for which it is issued, and shall not continue in force after the expiration or transfer of the license under which it is issued; provided, however, that if a complete renewal application is properly filed with the department, then each certificate issued in connection with the previously issued license shall continue in force until the department acts on the application. Each service issued a certificate of inspection shall cause such certificate to be displayed in such emergency medical services vehicle in such manner as the department may prescribe by regulation.
