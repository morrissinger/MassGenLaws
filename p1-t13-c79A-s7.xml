    	     Any displaced person eligible for payments under subsection (A) who is displaced from a dwelling and who elects to accept the payments authorized by this subsection in lieu of the payments authorized by subsection (A), may receive a moving expense allowance not to exceed three hundred dollars, determined in accordance with the prevailing fixed payment schedule of the department of highways, and a dislocation allowance of two hundred dollars.
        </section>
        <section prefix="C">
    	     Any displaced person eligible for payments under subsection (A) who is displaced from his place of business or from his farm operation and who elects to accept the payment authorized by this subsection in lieu of the payment authorized by said subsection (A), may receive a fixed payment in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business or farm operation, except that such payment shall not be less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars. In the case of a business, no payment shall be made under this subsection unless the business (1) cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage, and (2) is not part of a commercial enterprise having at least one other establishment not being acquired, which is engaged in the same or similar business. For purposes of this subsection, the term “average annual net earnings” means one half of any net earnings of the business or farm operation, before federal and state income taxes, during the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which such business or farm operation moves from the real property, or during such other period as the relocation agency determines to be more equitable for establishing such earnings, and includes any compensation paid by the business or farm operation to the owner, his spouse, or his dependents during such period.

        <section prefix="B">
    	     The additional payment authorized by this section shall be made only to such a displaced person who purchases and occupies a replacement dwelling which is decent, safe, and sanitary not later than the end of the one year period beginning on the date on which he receives final payment of all costs of the acquired dwelling, or on the date on which he moves from the acquired dwelling, whichever is the later date.

    	     To pay any increase in cost required to lease or rent for a period of four years, a decent, safe, and sanitary comparable replacement dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate such person in an area similar with regard to economic rents to the area of displacement, but not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities, and reasonably accessible to the displaced person’s place of employment, but not to exceed four thousand dollars. The cost of a comparable replacement dwelling shall be determined by analysis of existing available standard dwellings which are functionally equivalent and substantially the same as the dwelling from which the person is displaced, provided it is standard, in accordance with a method approved by the bureau of relocation, unless otherwise provided by federal law;

        <section prefix="B">
    	     To make a down payment, including incidental expenses described in clause 3 of subsection (A) of subdivision II, on the purchase of a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate the displaced household, and shall be in an amount equal to the amount which would have been required to pay any increase in rent for comparable replacement housing over a four year period as defined above. In no event may the total payment exceed four thousand dollars.
