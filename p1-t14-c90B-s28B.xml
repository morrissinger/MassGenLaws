        Notwithstanding section 28, upon conviction of, or adjudication of delinquency by reason of a violation of section 26A, the registrar shall immediately suspend the operatorâ€™s license or right to operate a motor vehicle and the director shall revoke the registration of any snow vehicle or recreation vehicle issued to such person. The registrar, after having suspended or revoked the license or right to operate of any person under this section, shall issue a new license or reinstate the right to operate and the director shall issue a new registration number, if the prosecution or adjudication of delinquency of such person is terminated in favor of the defendant or juvenile. The registrar may, after an investigation or upon hearing, issue a new license or reinstate the right to operate and the director may issue a new snow vehicle or recreation vehicle registration number to a person so convicted of or adjudicated delinquent by means of a violation of said section 26A; provided, however, that no such license or right to operate shall be issued by the registrar nor shall a registration number be issued by the director to a person convicted of a violation of subsection (a) of said section 26A, for a first offense, until 1 year after the date of suspension or revocation following his original conviction, or from the date of his original conviction if the person is unlicensed or has not been issued the right to operate or, for a subsequent offense, until 2 years after the date of such suspension, revocation or conviction, or to any person convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a violation of subsection (b) of said section 26A, for a first offense, until 2 years after the date of suspension or revocation or, if the person is unlicensed or has not been issued a right to operate, until 2 years after the date of his original conviction or adjudication or, for a subsequent offense, until 3 years after the date of such suspension, revocation, conviction or adjudication; provided, however, that a person whose license or right to operate was suspended due to a conviction of said subsection (a) of said section 26A may, after the expiration of 3 months from the date of conviction, apply for and shall be granted a hearing before the registrar for the purpose of requesting the issuance of a new license for employment or educational purposes, which license shall be effective for not more than an identical 12-hour period every day on the grounds of hardship and a showing by the person that the causes of the present and past violations have been dealt with or brought under control, and the registrar may, in his discretion, issue such license or right to operate under such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate and necessary; and provided further, that such person may, after the expiration of 6 months from the date of conviction, apply for and shall be granted a hearing before the registrar for the purpose of requesting the issuance of a new license or right to operate on a limited basis on the grounds of hardship and a showing by the person that the causes of the present and past violations have been dealt with or brought under control and the registrar may, in his discretion, issue such a license or right to operate under such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate and necessary. 
If the person so convicted or adjudicated is under age 17 at the time of such conviction or adjudication and has not been issued a license or right to operate or a snow vehicle or recreation vehicle registration number, the registrar shall not issue such license or right to operate a motor vehicle and the director shall not issue a snow or recreation vehicle registration until the time periods provided in the previous paragraph have passed but the calculation of such time period shall not commence until such person reaches age 16 for purposes of issuance of a right to operate a motor vehicle and 16 and one-half for purposes of issuance of a license to operate a motor vehicle and for issuance of a snow vehicle or recreation vehicle registration number.
