        The operation within this commonwealth by any person, by himself or his agent, of any aircraft, whether registered or unregistered, and whether with or without a license, permit or certificate to operate, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such person of the administrator for aeronautics, or his successor in office, to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful processes in any action or proceeding against him growing out of any accident or collision in which he may be involved while operating aircraft within the commonwealth, and such operation shall be a signification of agreement by such person that any lawful process against him which is served upon said administrator for aeronautics, or his successor in office, as such attorney shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on him personally, and that said chairman of the commission, and his successor in office, shall continue to be his said attorney so long as any liability on account of such an accident or collision remains outstanding against him. Sections three A to three E, inclusive, shall apply to such service.
