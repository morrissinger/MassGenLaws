        Except as otherwise provided, no person shall engage in the business of or act as a radio and television technician directly or indirectly, unless he is licensed; provided, however, that the board may, upon payment of a fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, issue a learner’s permit to an applicant who submits a written statement made under oath by a licensed master technician certifying that such person is employed by him and will work directly under his supervision and that he will be jointly responsible with him for work done by the applicant. Any such learner’s permit shall be valid only while the holder is employed by the master technician who submitted such certificate, and in no event for more than three years. Any sign, listing or other advertisement of a radio and television technician shall contain his license number. 
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to authorize a licensed radio and television technician to perform any work or services which may only be performed by persons licensed under chapter one hundred and forty-one. 
The board shall make no rules or regulations which will be in conflict with the provisions of chapter one hundred and forty-one or with any rule or regulation adopted thereunder.
