    <text>
        It is the policy of the commonwealth to promote and facilitate the fullest possible participation by all citizens in the affairs of the commonwealth. Minority, women and veterans business enterprises frequently face special handicaps and problems in achieving viable economic status. Various public and private programs have been initiated to assist minority, women and veterans business enterprises, where applicable, to achieve economic viability, though many businesses have not been adequately informed of these programs because of inadequate coordination and communication efforts, with the result that many services available are never adequately delivered to those who need them. The state government, as the biggest business in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, has a special responsibility to see that all available services and programs are put to the best use. These steps are necessary to guarantee the fullest participation by all citizens of the commonwealth in the economy of the state and to guarantee the fullest benefits to citizens of programs and services available for assistance.
