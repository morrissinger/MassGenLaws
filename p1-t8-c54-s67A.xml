        If the selectmen so vote, more than one state ballot box may be used at any polling place in any town at state elections and at town elections if official ballots are used therein. If more than one ballot box is to be used at any polling place as aforesaid, the voting lists for use thereat shall each be divided by the selectmen into as many sections as there are ballot boxes. Upon written request of the selectmen of a town for one or more additional ballot boxes for use as herein provided, the state secretary shall provide the same at the expense of such town.
