The board shall consist of 5 members appointed by the governor for a term of 4 years, 2 of whom shall be experts in the field of public or private transportation finance; 2 of whom shall have practical experience in transportation planning and policy; and 1 of whom shall be a registered civil engineer with at least 10 years experience. One of the members shall be appointed by the governor to serve as chairperson of the board; provided, however, that said designee shall not be an employee of the department, department or any division thereof. Not more than 3 of the directors shall be members of the same political party. Each director shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of their duties, including reimbursement for reasonable travel; provided, however that that such reimbursement shall not exceed $500 annually. Any person appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of a member of the board shall be appointed in a like manner and shall serve for only the unexpired term of such former member. Any director shall be eligible for reappointment. Any director may be removed from his appointment by the governor for cause. The board shall annually elect 1 of its members to serve as vice-chairperson.[ Subsection (b) as amended by 2012, 242, Sec. 3 effective August 9, 2012.
