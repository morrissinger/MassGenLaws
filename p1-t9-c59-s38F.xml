        A board of assessors may request the owner or lessee of any personal property to make a written return under oath within sixty days containing such information as may reasonably be required by it to determine the actual fair cash valuation of such property. 
Failure of an owner or lessee of personal property to comply with such request within sixty days after it has been made shall bar him from any statutory appeal under this chapter, unless such owner or lessee was unable to comply with such request for reasons beyond his control. If any owner or lessee of personal property in a return made under this section makes any statement which he knows to be false in a material particular, such false statement shall bar him from any statutory appeal under this chapter.
