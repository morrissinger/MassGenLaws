        Whenever it appears that there is a violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation, rule, order, permit or approval adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, the department or head of the fire department may issue to a person causing or contributing, or likely to cause or contribute, to such violation or potential violation an order requiring the production or analysis of samples, or the production of records, or imposing such restraints on or requiring such action by said person, as the department or the head of the fire department reasonably deems necessary or desirable to abate or to prevent such violation or potential violation. Issuance of an order under this section shall not preclude, and shall not be deemed an election to forego, any other remedy authorized by law.
