        At any time after the election, upon written request of any person, the city or town clerk shall, within a reasonable time, open the envelope in which the voting lists have been enclosed, as provided in section one hundred and seven, and make a copy of the lists as checked. The clerk shall thereupon furnish a copy of said lists to the person making the request on payment of a reasonable fee or shall allow such person to examine and copy said lists without charge under such supervision as the clerk may reasonably require. After any such voting list has been so copied, said clerk shall at once enclose it in an envelope, seal up the same and certify thereon to the identity of such lists.
