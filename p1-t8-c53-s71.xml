        In cities and towns which have not accepted the provisions of law relating to primaries for the nomination of municipal officers, political parties which nominate candidates for elective city or town offices shall do so by direct plurality vote in caucuses, except when city or town charters provide otherwise. All provisions of law relative to the preparation of nomination papers and ballots, to primaries and elections, to ballots cast at primaries and elections, and to recounts of such ballots, shall, so far as applicable, apply to such caucuses.
