    	     such vehicle is covered by a policy of insurance which shall indemnify the insured against any liability for personal injury, the death of any person or property damage, which injury, death or damage may result from or have been caused by the use or operation of the vanpool vehicle described in the contract of insurance. The amount of such insurance or indemnity against claims for personal injury or death shall be not less than one million dollars.

No such insurance or bond shall be subject to nonrenewal or cancellation while the registration is in force unless said registrar has been given at least twenty daysâ€™ written notice prior to the effective date of nonrenewal or cancellation. If within such twenty day period said registrar is not presented with satisfactory evidence that other insurance or another indemnity bond has been obtained the registration shall be revoked. Liability under such insurance policy or bond shall continue beyond such twenty day notification period until such time as the registration for such vanpool vehicle has been surrendered and its plates have been returned to said registrar, but in no case shall such liability continue for more than ten days after such notification period has expired.
