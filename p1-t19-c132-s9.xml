        The forester may establish and maintain nurseries for the propagation of forest tree seedlings upon such lands of the commonwealth at any state institution as the superintendent or trustees thereof may set apart for this purpose and upon such other lands as may be acquired under this section. Superintendents of institutions where land is set apart therefor may furnish without charge the labor of their inmates necessary to establish and maintain said nurseries. All stock grown in nurseries established under this section shall be used within the commonwealth. The forester may distribute seeds and seedlings to land owners, citizens of the commonwealth, under such conditions and restrictions as he may determine, subject to the approval of the governor and council. The forester, with the advice and consent of the governor and council, may expend from time to time such sum as is appropriated therefor by the general court in purchasing, for the establishment of nurseries provided for by this section, lands situated within the commonwealth and adapted to the propagation of forest seedlings.
