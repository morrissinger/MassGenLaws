        No building permit shall be issued for the construction of a building which would necessitate the use of water therein, unless a supply of water is available therefor either from a water system operated by a city, town or district, or from a well located on the land where the building is to be constructed, or from a water corporation or company, as defined in section one of chapter one hundred and sixty-five. 
Every city or town shall require, as a condition of issuing a building permit or license for the demolition, renovation, rehabilitation or other alteration of a building or structure, that the debris resulting from such demolition, renovation, rehabilitation or alteration be disposed of in a properly licensed solid waste disposal facility, as defined by section one hundred and fifty A of chapter one hundred and eleven. Any such permit or license shall indicate the location of the facility at which the debris is to be disposed. If for any reason, the debris will not be disposed of as indicated, the permittee or licensee shall notify the issuing authority as to the location where the debris will be disposed. The issuing authority shall amend the permit or license to so indicate.
