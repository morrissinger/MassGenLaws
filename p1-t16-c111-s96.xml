        A magistrate authorized to issue warrants may issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of the county or his deputy, or to any constable or police officer, requiring him, under the direction of the board of health, to remove any person infected with a disease dangerous to the public health or who is a carrier of the causative agent thereof, or to take control of convenient houses and lodgings, and to impress into service and use such convenient houses, lodgings, nurses, attendants and other necessaries. The removal authorized by this section may be made to a hospital in any town established for the reception of persons having diseases dangerous to the public health; provided, that the assent of the board of health of the town to which such removal is to be made shall first have been obtained.
