        The coordinate system based upon the North American Datum of 1927 which prior to the enactment of this statute was defined as the Massachusetts Coordinate System shall be now designated the Coordinate System, North American Datum of 1927, (NAD 1927), and can continue in use for the preparation of any maps, reports of survey, or other documents, until such time as the Board of Registration of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors declares, with the concurrence of the chief engineer of the Massachusetts department of public works, by regulation that said Coordinate System, (North American Datum of 1927), shall no longer be used except for interpreting existing maps, reports of surveys, deeds or other documents. For the Coordinate System, North American Datum, 1927 the commonwealth is divided into the same two zones defined in section eight.
