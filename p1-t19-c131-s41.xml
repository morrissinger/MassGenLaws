        If the director determines that any fisheries in the inland waters of the commonwealth are of sufficient value to warrant the prohibition or regulation of the discharge of any waste or other material from any source, which may, directly or indirectly, injure such fisheries, he may thereupon give written notice of such determination to the director of the division of water pollution control, who shall take appropriate action under the provisions of sections twenty-six to fifty-three, inclusive, of chapter twenty-one.
