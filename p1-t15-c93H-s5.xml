        This chapter does not relieve a person or agency from the duty to comply with requirements of any applicable general or special law or federal law regarding the protection and privacy of personal information; provided however, a person who maintains procedures for responding to a breach of security pursuant to federal laws, rules, regulations, guidance, or guidelines, is deemed to be in compliance with this chapter if the person notifies affected Massachusetts residents in accordance with the maintained or required procedures when a breach occurs; provided further that the person also notifies the attorney general and the director of the office of consumer affairs and business regulation of the breach as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay following the breach. The notice to be provided to the attorney general and the director of the office of consumer affairs and business regulation shall consist of, but not be limited to, any steps the person or agency has taken or plans to take relating to the breach pursuant to the applicable federal law, rule, regulation, guidance or guidelines; provided further that if said person or agency does not comply with applicable federal laws, rules, regulations, guidance or guidelines, then it shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
