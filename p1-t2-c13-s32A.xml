        There shall be a board of electricians’ appeals, whose membership shall consist of the members of the state examiners of electricians. The chairman of the state examiners of electricians shall be the chairman of said board. Said board may make such rules or regulations, not inconsistent with law, as it may deem necessary in the performance of its duties and may establish forms of appeals and petitions, and reasonable fees, the amount of which shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven for the filing thereof. Said board shall hold such meetings as are required to perform its duties. Notice of all meetings, including the time and place, shall be required by rules or regulations. A majority of said board may transact business, but a lesser number may adjourn from time to time. 
No member of said board shall act or vote as such on any matter in connection with which his private interest, as distinguished from the public interest, is immediately concerned. 
The state examiners of electricians shall assign such clerical, technical and other assistance as may be required by the board of electricians’ appeals.
