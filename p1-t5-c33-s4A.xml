        The National Lancers shall be organized as the commander-in-chief directs, and may retain its name and the right to wear such distinctive uniform as may be approved by the commander-in-chief, and its ancient privileges, including its method of selecting its officers and conducting its internal affairs, so long as the same are not repugnant to the laws of the commonwealth or of the United States. Said organization may use land and stable facilities belonging to the commonwealth for its activities, equipment and exercises without charge and may receive from the commonwealth, its departments, divisions or bureaus or the federal government, without charge, any surplus equipment, goods, or other materials, as are available, provided that all such equipment, goods and materials remain the property of the commonwealth and are accounted for as such.
