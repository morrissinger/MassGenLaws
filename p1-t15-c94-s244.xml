Such certificate shall be given to said person and shall be given by him only to the owner of the goods or material or his agent when he unloads the same; and each such person, on request and without charge therefor, shall permit the director of standards, or any inspector of standards in any town, or any sealer of weights and measures of any town, to examine the certificate and to make a copy thereof.
