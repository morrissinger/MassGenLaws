        The commission may appoint, employ and determine the compensation, duties and conditions of employment of an executive director and such other officers as the commission shall deem necessary, who shall not be members of the commission and who shall serve at the pleasure of the commission; provided, however, that the commission may bind itself by contract to employ an executive director, and such other officers, but no such contract may be for a period of more than five years. The executive director shall be the chief executive officer of the commission and shall administer and direct its affairs as authorized or approved by the commission and shall have such of the powers and perform such of the duties of the commission as the commission may from time to time have delegated to him and not recalled. The executive director or his designee as approved by the commission shall be the secretary of the commission and shall keep a record of the proceedings of the commission and shall be custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the commission, the minute book or journal of the commission and its official seal. The executive director and any other officer designated by the commission for this purpose, each alone, may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the commission and may give certificates under its official seal to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the commission may rely upon such certificates. Before the issuance of any bonds under the provisions of this chapter the executive director and any other member or officer of the commission charged with responsibility for the issuance thereof, shall each execute a surety bond in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars payable to the commission, or in lieu thereof the commission shall obtain a blanket position bond covering the executive director and any other member or officer of the commission charged with responsibility for the issuance of any bonds to be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of their offices, to be executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in the commonwealth as surety and approved by the commission. 
The commission may from time to time hire, transfer or otherwise appoint or employ legal counsel, financial advisors and such other experts, engineers, agents, accountants, clerks, and other consultants and employees as it deems necessary and determine their duties. 
The commission may purchase insurance on behalf of itself and any of its members, officers, employees or agents against any liability arising out of his status as such, whether or not the commission would have the power to indemnify him against such liability. 
The commission shall operate on a fiscal year commencing July first unless otherwise provided by the commission. 
All officers or employees hired, transferred or otherwise appointed by the commission, other than a person transferring to or hired by the commission from employment with the municipality who is not subject to a residency requirement under the laws of the municipality prior to transfer, shall be subject to any residency requirements which apply to persons employed by the municipality.
