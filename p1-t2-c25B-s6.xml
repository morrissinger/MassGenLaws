        The commissioner shall adopt procedures for testing the energy efficiency of the appliances and lamps covered by this chapter if such procedures are not provided for in any other applicable code regarding the testing of appliance efficiency. The commissioner shall use United States Department of Energy approved test methods, or in the absence of such test methods, other appropriate nationally recognized test methods applicable to the respective appliances and lamps. The manufacturer shall cause the testing of samples of each model of each appliance and lamp covered by this chapter in accordance with the test procedures adopted pursuant to this section or those specified in any other applicable code regarding the testing of appliance efficiency. 
The commissioner may test products covered by section 3. If products so tested are found not to be in compliance with the minimum efficiency standards established under section 5, the commissioner shall: (1) charge the manufacturer of such product for the cost of product purchase and testing, and (2) provide information to the public on products found not to be in compliance with the standards. 
In adopting test procedures for determining energy efficiency, the commissioner may consult with other appropriate department heads and may adopt updated test methods when new versions of test procedures become available.
