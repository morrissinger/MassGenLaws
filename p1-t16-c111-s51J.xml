        [ Text of section added by 2012, 224, Sec. 80 effective November 4, 2012.]  The department shall promulgate regulations regarding limited services clinics. The regulations shall promote the availability of limited services clinics as a point of access for health care services within the full scope of practice of a nurse practitioner.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to allow a limited service clinic to serve as a patient's primary care provider. Further, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to allow a limited service clinic to refer patients to a non-primary care provider, unless the limited service clinic is a satellite of, or is otherwise affiliated with, a health care facility licensed under section 51 or other licensed practitioners and the non-primary care provider practice in the facility or is a licensed practitioner.
