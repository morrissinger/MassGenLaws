        The applicant for registration may, in lieu of procuring a motor vehicle liability bond or policy, deposit with the state treasurer cash in the amount of ten thousand dollars or bonds, stocks or other evidences of indebtedness satisfactory to said treasurer of a market value of not less than ten thousand dollars as security for the payment by such applicant or by any person responsible for the operation of such applicant’s motor vehicle with his express or implied consent of all judgments rendered against such applicant or against such person in actions to recover damages for bodily injuries, including death at any time resulting therefrom, judgments rendered as aforesaid for consequential damages consisting of expenses incurred by a husband, wife, parent or guardian for medical, nursing, hospital or surgical services, or for indemnity, in connection with or on account of such bodily injuries or death, and judgments rendered as aforesaid for contribution as a joint tortfeasor in connection with or on account of such bodily injuries, sustained during the term of registration by any person other than a guest occupant of such motor vehicle or any employee of the owner or registrant of such motor vehicle or of such other person responsible as aforesaid who is entitled to payments or benefits under the provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-two, and arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, control or use of such motor vehicle upon the ways of the commonwealth or in any place therein to which the public has a right of access, to the amount or limit of at least ten thousand dollars on account of any such judgment; provided, however, that if the applicant for registration is engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles under any system referred to in section thirty-two C, such applicant shall deposit with said treasurer additional security in the amount or value of at least one thousand dollars for the payment by such applicant or by any person responsible for the operation of such applicant’s motor vehicle with his express or implied consent, including such consent imputed under section thirty-two E, of all judgments rendered against such applicant or against such person in actions to recover damages for injury to property and judgments rendered as aforesaid for indemnity, or for contribution as a joint tortfeasor, sustained during the term of registration by any person, and arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, control or use upon the ways of the commonwealth of such motor vehicle, to the amount or limit of at least one thousand dollars on account of any such judgment and provided further that no such deposit shall be required in the case of vehicles leased for a term of more than thirty days and the depositor shall in writing authorize the state treasurer to pay over to the insurer assigned a claim under section thirty-four N any and all amounts, including without limitation the reasonable costs of investigating and settling any such claim and such other reasonable expenses expended by it to satisfy a claim for personal injury protection made against it by any person, other than the depositor or members of his household, who is entitled to such payments as a result of the unavailability of personal injury protection benefits on said depositor’s motor vehicle. The depositor shall be entitled to the interest accruing on his deposit and to the income payable on the securities deposited and may from time to time with the consent of the state treasurer change such securities. Upon presentation to the state treasurer by an officer qualified to serve civil process or an execution issued on any such judgment against the registrant or other person responsible as aforesaid, said treasurer shall pay, out of the cash deposited by the registrant as herein provided, the amount of the execution, including costs and interest, up to but not in excess of ten thousand dollars. If the registrant has deposited bonds, stocks or other evidences of indebtedness, the state treasurer shall, on presentation of an execution as aforesaid, cause the said securities or such part thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment to be sold at public auction, giving the registrant three days’ notice in writing of the time and place of said sale, and from the proceeds of said sale the state treasurer shall, after paying the expenses thereof, satisfy the execution as hereinbefore provided when a cash deposit has been made. Any payment upon an execution by the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of this section shall discharge him from all official and personal liability whatever to the registrant to the extent of such payment. The state treasurer shall, whenever the amount of such deposit from any cause falls below the amount required by this section, require, at the option of the registrants, the deposit of additional cash or securities up to the amount required by this section or a motor vehicle liability bond or policy as provided in this chapter. Money or securities deposited with the state treasurer under the provisions of this section shall not be subject to attachment or execution except as provided in this section. The state treasurer shall deposit any cash received under the provisions of this section in a savings bank or the savings department of a trust company or of a national bank within the commonwealth, or on paid-up shares and accounts of and in co-operative banks, or shall use such cash to purchase share accounts in federal savings and loan associations located in the commonwealth.
