    	     authorize tax increment exemptions from property taxes, under clause Fifty-first of section 5 of chapter 59, for a specified term not to exceed 20 years, for any parcel of real property which is located in the MWT-TIF zone and for which an agreement has been executed with the owner of the parcel under clause (iv); provided, however, that the MWT-TIF plan shall specify the level of exemptions expressed as exemption percentages, not to exceed 100 per cent, to be used in calculating the exemptions for the parcel, and for personal property situated on that parcel, as provided under said clause Fifty-first of said section 5 of said chapter 59; provided, further, that the exemption for each parcel of real property shall be calculated using an adjustment factor for each fiscal year of the specified term equal to the product of the inflation factors for each fiscal year since the parcel first became eligible for such exemption pursuant to this clause; provided, further, that the inflation factor for each fiscal year shall be a ratio:
        </section>
        <section prefix="a">
    	     the numerator of which shall be the total assessed value of all parcels of all commercial and industrial real estate that is assessed at full and fair cash value for the current fiscal year minus the new growth adjustment for the current fiscal year attributable to the commercial and industrial real estate as determined by the commissioner of revenue under paragraph (f) of section 21C of said chapter 59; and

        <section prefix="vi">
    	     be certified as an approved MWT-TIF plan by the economic assistance coordinating council established by section 3B of chapter 23A pursuant to regulations adopted by said council if the council finds, based on the information submitted in support of the MWT-TIF plan by the city or town and such additional investigation as the council shall make, and incorporate in its minutes, that the plan is consistent with the requirements of this section and shall further the public purpose of retaining or encouraging increased industrial and commercial manufacturing activity in the commonwealth. A city or town may at any time revoke its designation of a TIF zone and, as a consequence of such revocation, shall immediately cease the execution of any additional agreements pursuant to clause (iv).
