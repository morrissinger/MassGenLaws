        The director shall furnish to the treasurer of every city, town and district, forms for the issue of notes for money borrowed by the city, town or district. Every such note shall contain blanks for insertion of the amount thereof, the date of issue, which shall be construed as the date from which interest is payable, the interest which it bears, the date when it will become due, and such other matters as the director may deem necessary; and a record of every such note shall be kept by said treasurer in such form as the director may designate. The director may place upon notes submitted to him for certification such denominations as will show the purpose for which they are issued and as may be required by law to appear thereon.
