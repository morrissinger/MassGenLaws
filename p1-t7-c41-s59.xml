They shall also prepare estimates of any income likely to be received by the town during the ensuing fiscal year in connection with the townâ€™s business or property intrusted to their care. The selectmen shall include in their estimates the salaries and expenses connected with their own office, and the salaries of all other town officers shall be included in the estimates for the office, department or branch of the public service of which they are in charge. The treasurer shall, in addition to his estimate of the amount required for the maintenance of his own office, prepare a separate statement indicating the amounts required for the payment of interest on the town debt and for the payment of such portions of the town debt as may become due during the ensuing fiscal year.
