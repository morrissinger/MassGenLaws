        To each resident and nonresident hunting or sporting license shall be attached a deer tag in a form prescribed by the director. Such deer tag shall remain attached to said license until removed for the purpose of affixing to a deer as provided herein and shall be void if detached for any other purpose. A person possessing a detached deer tag not affixed to a deer shall surrender the same to any officer empowered to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Immediately upon taking a deer into possession by hunting in open season, said tag shall be affixed to the deer in such manner and for such time as may be prescribed by rules and regulations of the director. This section shall not apply to a deer taken by a person hunting lawfully without a license. A person shall not have in his possession or under his control in any motor vehicle or transport the carcass of a deer except as provided in rules and regulations promulgated by the director. Possession of the carcass of a deer except as tagged or authorized herein shall be prima facie evidence that the same was unlawfully taken. Proceedings under any rule or regulation made under authority of this section or of section five and which pertains to the tagging or reporting of any deer killed may be begun in the district court within the judicial district of which the deer is found or the defendant lives.
