        The commissioner is authorized to abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in respect thereof, if the amount due does not exceed $100 and the commissioner determines, under uniform rules prescribed by him, that the administration and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due.
