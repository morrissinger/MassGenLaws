        The decision of the civil service commission shall be final and binding on all agents and agencies of the commonwealth; provided, however, that any such decision may have retroactive effect pursuant to the applicable provisions of section forty-nine and also pursuant to rules made under the provisions of section fifty-three; and, provided further, that no such decision shall require any payment to be made as of any date before the beginning of the fiscal year in which such decision shall be rendered, except to the extent such payment is permitted pursuant to the provisions of said section forty-nine and subject to appropriation for the purposes thereof. If such decision shall require the payment of money to any employee of the commonwealth, the civil service commission shall notify the appointing authority, the personnel administrator, the budget director, and the comptroller of the amount or amounts thereof, and such amount or amounts shall be paid from available appropriations if in accordance with law.
