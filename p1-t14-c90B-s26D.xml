    <text>
        A summons may be issued instead of a warrant for arrest upon a complaint for a violation of section 26A or 26B if in the judgment of the court or justice receiving the complaint there is reason to believe that the defendant will appear upon a summons. Nothing in this section shall limit a law enforcement officerâ€™s power to arrest under any other provisions of the General Laws or at common law.
