    <text>
        Whenever the commissioners or their authorized agents deem it necessary to make reconnaissances, surveys, soundings, inspections or examinations to obtain information for the layout and construction of highways or other projects under their jurisdiction, said commissioners or their authorized agents or employees may, after due notice by registered mail, given by the commissioners or their authorized agents, enter upon such lands, waters and premises, not including buildings, in their respective counties as they may deem necessary or convenient for the purposes of this chapter, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass nor shall an entry for such purposes be deemed an entry under eminent domain proceedings. The county shall make reimbursement for any injury or actual damage to such lands, waters and premises caused by any act of the authorized agents or employees, and shall so far as possible restore such lands to the condition in which they were prior to making such entry. Such reimbursement shall be assessed upon the respective towns within which said areas have been entered upon.
