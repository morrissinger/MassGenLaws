        The child advocate may request the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents, papers, books, records, reports, reviews, recommendations, correspondence, data and other evidence that the child advocate reasonably believes is relevant. If a request is denied, the child advocate shall have the power to issue a subpoena for witnesses and the production of documents and any other data and evidence that the child advocate reasonably believes is relevant. 
If any person to whom a subpoena is issued fails to appear or, having appeared, refuses to give testimony or fails to produce the evidence required, the child advocate may apply to the Suffolk county superior court to issue an order to compel the testimony and production of documents of any such witnesses. A failure to obey the order may be punished as contempt. 
The district attorney may seek injunctive relief in Suffolk county superior court to defer a subpoena issued by the child advocate.
