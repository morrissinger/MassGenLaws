        In order best to carry out the provisions of sections twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four and twenty-five, and sections fifty-one and fifty-two of chapter thirty, there shall be established an advisory standardization board, consisting of the state purchasing agent as its head and such representatives of the several departments, offices and commissions most affected by said provisions as shall be designated by the heads thereof. Said board shall consider and advise as to the needs of the various state activities, how far they can be reasonably harmonized and covered by standard specifications, and what, if any, materials are so lacking in importance or uniformity as to warrant blanket authorization for their local purchase.
