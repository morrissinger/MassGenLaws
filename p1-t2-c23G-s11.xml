        The Marine Seafood Processing Revolving Loan Fund established under the provisions of section 38A of chapter 23A shall be under the control of the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency but shall consist of a separate account or accounts segregated from other Agency funds, to which shall be credited any appropriations made to the Agency for seafood processing industry purposes, together with such other accounts as may become available from any other source. The Agency may from time to time withdraw from the Marine Seafood Processing Loan Fund such amounts as may be necessary to provide funds for the administration of this section and sections 13 and 14. No funds shall be appropriated nor credited to the fund until the advisory council established pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 12, has filed an approved, recommended program with the clerks of the senate and the house of representatives and with the commissioner of administration.
