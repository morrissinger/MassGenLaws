        The superior courts or the Boston, Springfield, Bristol county and Worcester juvenile courts or a district court, except the municipal court of the city of Boston, may authorize a probation officer to expend such amount as the court considers expedient for the temporary support or transportation, or both, of a person placed on probation. A record of any amount so authorized shall be entered on the clerkâ€™s docket of the case. 
The chief probation officer of the municipal court of the city of Boston may provide for the temporary support or transportation, or both, of a person placed on probation in said court, or for the relief of the immediate distress of such person, in any manner which he may deem proper, and for these purposes may annually expend a sum not exceeding two thousand dollars for all such cases of relief. At the end of each month said chief probation officer shall submit to the administrative justice of said court a list of the expenses so incurred, with proper vouchers, and upon approval of the administrative justice the amount thereof shall be paid to the chief probation officer by the commonwealth.
