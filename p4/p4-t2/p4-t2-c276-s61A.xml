        Whenever a person becomes bail or surety in a criminal case and has offered real estate as his qualification for his acceptance as such bail or surety, and subsequently and while the case in which he has qualified as bail or surety is pending, desires to dispose of or encumber such real estate, he shall in writing notify the court in which the case is then pending of his desire, and shall, unless expressly authorized by the court to continue as such bail or surety, terminate his liability as such bail or surety before he disposes of or encumbers such real estate. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than one year, or both. Nothing in this section shall in any wise affect the title to such real estate.
