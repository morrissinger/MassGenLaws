He shall report to the court, and his records may at all times be inspected by police officials of the towns of the commonwealth; provided, that his records in cases arising under sections fifty-two to fifty-nine, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and nineteen shall not be open to inspection without the consent of a justice of his court.
