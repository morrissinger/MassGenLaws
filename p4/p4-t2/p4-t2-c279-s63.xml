        The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, may from time to time respite the execution of a sentence of death for stated periods so long as he may consider it necessary to afford him, with the advice and consent of the council, an opportunity to investigate and consider the facts of the case for the purpose of considering whether or not to pardon the prisoner.
