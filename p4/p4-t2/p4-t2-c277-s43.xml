        In an indictment for perjury alleged to have been committed in a criminal case an allegation of the substance of the crime shall be sufficient; if alleged to have been committed in a civil case, an allegation of the nature of the controversy in general terms shall be sufficient. In both cases, the court or magistrate before whom the oath or affirmation was taken shall be alleged, but no part of the proceeding in which, or the commission or authority of the court or person before whom, the perjury was committed need be alleged.
