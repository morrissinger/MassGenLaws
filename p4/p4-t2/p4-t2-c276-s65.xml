        The condition of a recognizance of a person, either with or without surety, binding him to appear before a court or justice to answer to a charge against him or to prosecute an appeal shall be so framed as to bind him personally to appear at the time so expressed, and at any subsequent time to which the case may be continued, unless previously surrendered or discharged, and so from time to time, until the final decree, sentence or order of the court or justice thereon, and to abide such final sentence, order or decree, and not depart without leave. The condition of a recognizance of a person held to answer to a charge before a district court shall be further so framed as to bind him to appear before the district court to answer to the charge or to answer to any indictment which may be returned against him. The superior court shall by rule provide for the forms of recognizances and bail bonds. A recognizance of a person held to answer to a complaint before a district court which is required by law to sit in more than one municipality may, with his consent or at his request, be conditioned for his appearance at the next sitting of the court at any one of said municipalities.
