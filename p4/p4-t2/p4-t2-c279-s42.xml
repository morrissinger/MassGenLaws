    <text>
        If judgment is rendered against a corporation upon an indictment or complaint under the laws of the commonwealth, the court may issue a warrant of distress to compel payment of the penalty or assessment, as the case may be, as prescribed by law, together with interest thereon if so ordered by the court. 
If the records of the registrar of motor vehicles indicate that a corporation has failed to pay an assessment for a civil motor vehicle infraction as provided in section three of chapter ninety C, the registrar may issue a warrant of distress to compel payment of the assessment, plus any late fees or other administrative fees which the registrar is required or authorized by law or regulation to impose, unless such fees are waived in whole or in part by the registrar.
