        The governor, if he deems the public good so requires, may offer a suitable reward of not more than ten thousand dollars in any one case to be paid by the commonwealth to any person who, in consequence of such offer, apprehends, brings back and secures a person who is convicted of or charged with a felony, who has escaped from prison in the commonwealth, or to any person who, in consequence of such offer, apprehends and secures a person charged with such crime, or for information that shall lead to the arrest and conviction of any person who has committed a felony, if the person cannot be arrested and secured in the common course of proceedings. If more than one claimant applies for the payment of such reward, the governor shall determine to whom it shall be paid, and if to more than one person, in what proportion to each, and his determination shall be final.
