    <text>
        Whenever a person is arrested for a crime and is taken to or confined in a jail, police station or lockup, the officer in charge thereof shall immediately examine the prisoner, and if he finds any bruises, cuts or other injuries shall forthwith make a written report thereof to the chief of police of the town concerned, or in Boston to the police commissioner, and in towns where there is no chief of police to the selectmen. The requirement that the prisoner be examined shall not be deemed to compel the removal of clothing. When a person is transferred from one place of confinement to another prior to his arraignment in court or to his release, the requirement that he shall be examined shall apply only to the place to which he is first taken after his arrest. Whoever violates this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than ten dollars.
