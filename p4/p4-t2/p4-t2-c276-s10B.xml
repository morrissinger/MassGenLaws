        If an arrest is made in this commonwealth by an officer of another state in accordance with the provisions of the preceding section he shall without unnecessary delay take the person arrested before a justice, associate justice or special justice of a court of record in the county in which the arrest was made, who shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of the arrest. If such justice, associate justice or special justice determines that the arrest was lawful he shall commit the person arrested to await for a reasonable time the issuance of a rendition warrant by the governor of the state from which he fled. If such justice, associate justice or special justice determines that the arrest was unlawful he shall discharge the person arrested.
