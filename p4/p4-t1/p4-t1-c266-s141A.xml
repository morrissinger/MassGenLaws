In a prosecution under this section, evidence that a dealer, as defined in section one of chapter ninety, or a person required to be licensed under the provisions of section fifty-nine of chapter one hundred and forty, by himself or by another turned back or readjusted the speedometer or odometer shall constitute prima facie evidence of such intent to misrepresent.
