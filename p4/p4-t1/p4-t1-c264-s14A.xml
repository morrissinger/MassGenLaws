The salary may be paid by such city or town notwithstanding that the teacher to whom it is paid is not actually rendering service within the schools thereof. The exchange teacher from abroad shall not be required to take or subscribe to any oaths or pledge of allegiance which is inconsistent with his citizenship in a foreign country.
