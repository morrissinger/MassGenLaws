        If a fictitious or pretended signature, purporting to be the signature of an officer or agent of a corporation, is fraudulently affixed to an instrument or writing purporting to be a note, draft or other evidence of debt issued by such corporation, with intent to pass the same as true, it shall be a forgery, although no such person may ever have been an officer or agent of such corporation, or ever have existed.
