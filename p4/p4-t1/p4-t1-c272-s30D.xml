    <text>
        The superior court shall also have jurisdiction to enjoin the dissemination of any visual material that contains a representation or reproduction of any posture or exhibition in a state of nudity or of any act that depicts, describes, or represents sexual conduct participated or engaged in by a child who is under eighteen years of age. The procedures for issuance of such injunction shall be the same as those provided in section thirty, and are in addition to other criminal proceedings initiated under any provisions of the General Laws, and not a condition precedent thereto.
