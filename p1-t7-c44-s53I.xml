        A city or town, for the celebration of the two hundredth, two hundred and fiftieth, three hundredth and three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its settlement or incorporation, may appropriate money annually during the five years preceding such anniversary. Notwithstanding the provisions of section fifty-three or any other law to the contrary, such city or town may establish in its treasury a special fund in which shall be deposited such sums as may be appropriated by it under the provisions of this section, and any and all sums received from the sale of commemorative items or from admission charges for commemorative ceremonies or events. Any and all such sums received by the treasurer shall be kept separate from other moneys, funds or property of such city or town and the principal and interest thereof may, from time to time upon the authorization of the mayor or city manager, as the case may be, the board of selectmen or the majority of any special committee established to plan such celebration, be expended for the purposes of said celebration in the year of such celebration and in the year preceding or succeeding the same. Any surplus remaining in said special fund after such celebration is concluded, shall be transferred by such treasurer into the treasury of such city or town.
