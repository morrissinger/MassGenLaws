        No person shall enter upon, or continue in, the practice of medicine within the commonwealth until he has presented to the clerk of the city or town where he has, or intends to have, an office or his usual place of business, his certificate of registration as a physician in the commonwealth, or, if it is lost, a certified statement issued by the board, setting forth all the material facts in the original certificate, and paying the fee provided by clause (58) of section thirty-four of chapter two hundred and sixty-two. Thereupon the clerk shall record the name of the owner of said certificate or certified statement, together with the date of record upon blanks, said blanks to be so arranged that a duplicate carbon copy shall be made at the time of the original record. He shall keep the original as a part of his official records and it shall be open to public inspection. Whoever practices or attempts to practice medicine without complying with this section, or whoever submits to a city or town clerk a false or fraudulent certificate or certified statement, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five nor more than one hundred dollars; and any city or town clerk who refuses or neglects to comply with this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than five nor more than ten dollars.
