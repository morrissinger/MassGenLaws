        Notwithstanding chapters 134 and 147, if money, goods or other property which has been abandoned, mislaid or lost on the premises of the department comes into the possession of the department and remains unclaimed for a period of 120 days, the department may sell the same, excepting money so unclaimed, at public auction after notice of such sale has been published for 3 successive weeks in a newspaper published in the city or town wherein such sale shall occur. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the cost of storage and the expenses of the sale, and all money so unclaimed, shall be paid into and become the property of the department and may be deposited in the Massachusetts Transportation Trust Fund. If such property is in the possession of the department and remains unclaimed for a period of 120 days and is of the value of $3 or less, the department may donate the same to a charitable organization.
