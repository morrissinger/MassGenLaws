        The governor shall annually issue a proclamation setting aside the twenty-sixth day of August as Susan B. Anthony Day, recommending its observance by the public in honoring the woman who was the organizer, lecturer, campaigner and ardent advocate in the fight for American woman suffrage, and whose unfailing efforts culminated in the prohibition of the denial of the right to vote on account of sex.
