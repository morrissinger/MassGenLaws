        The department, if it can obtain consent of the owner, shall remove the trees, limbs of trees, shrubbery or any structure or other obstacle from lands bordering upon state highways, which in its opinion obstruct the view of persons traveling upon the highway or make traveling thereon dangerous. If the owner does not desire the material which has been so removed, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of it. The department shall cause all debris resulting from any cutting or trimming done along the state highway, under authority of this or of any other chapter, to be disposed of in such manner that it will not constitute a fire menace to adjoining property.
