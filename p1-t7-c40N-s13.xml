        The commission may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the commission deems to be in the public interest. Refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming bonds being refunded and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by a trust agreement or resolution securing bonds. The issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties and obligations of the commission in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable.
