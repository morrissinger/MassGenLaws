        Premium assistance payments shall be made under a schedule set annually by the board, in consultation with the office of Medicaid and the health safety net office; provided that this schedule shall be published on or before September 30, starting in 2006. Premium assistance payments shall not be subject to appropriation from the fund, established by section 2OOO of chapter 29, and shall be made directly by the connector to eligible health insurance plans, under chapter 176Q. If the director determines that amounts in the fund are insufficient to meet the projected costs of enrolling new eligible individuals, the director shall impose a cap on enrollment in the program.
