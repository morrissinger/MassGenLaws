        A person who desires to be certified as a health officer shall file with said board an application upon a form to be prescribed and furnished by the board. He shall include in such application under oath his qualifications as a health officer. Said application shall be accompanied by a registration fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. 
If the board deems the educational qualifications of an applicant are satisfactory and if such applicant passes a written examination satisfactory to the board, the board shall issue to him a certificate. Said certification shall expire at the end of the calendar year and may be renewed on or before January fifteen of the following year; provided, however, that a person seeking such renewal shall provide evidence of such continuing education as the board shall require by regulation. The fee for renewal or certification shall be determined under the aforementioned provision, and shall be acknowledged by sending the person certified a notice of renewal.
