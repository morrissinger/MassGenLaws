        Any person affected by an order of the department or of a division or officer thereof, may, within such times as the colonel may fix, which shall not be less than ten days after notice of such order, appeal to the colonel who shall thereupon grant a hearing, and after such hearing the colonel may amend, suspend or revoke such order. Any person aggrieved by an order approved by the colonel may appeal to the superior court; provided, that such appeal is taken within fifteen days from the date when such order is approved or made. The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity upon such appeal to annul such order if found to exceed the authority of the department or upon petition of the colonel to enforce all valid orders issued by the department. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to deprive any person of the right to pursue any other lawful remedy.
