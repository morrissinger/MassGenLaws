        The parole board may, by a majority vote of all of the members,issue to a parolee under its supervision a certificate of termination of sentence, provided that in the judgment of the board such termination of sentence shall be in the public interest; and provided, further, that in no case will such certificate of termination of sentence be issued unless the parolee has completed at least one year of satisfactory parole; provided, however, that the parole board, by a majority vote of all its members, may grant a certificate of termination if the parolee has successfully completed the so-called special incarceration boot camp program and subsequently completed at least four months of satisfactory parole. The parole board shall furnish to the commissioner of correction and to the judge who pronounced sentence upon the parolee a copy of such certificate of termination of sentence.
