        Incorporated and unincorporated religious societies and churches may appoint trustees, not exceeding five, to hold and manage trust funds for their benefit, who shall hold their offices for three years and until others are appointed in their stead. At or before the time of the first appointment of such trustees, the society may establish regulations for their government, which shall not be subject to alteration or amendment except by consent of all the trustees then in office and by a two thirds vote of the church or society interested therein. Any funds held by the bodies corporate mentioned in the two preceding sections may be transferred to said trustees to be held in trust in like manner by them.
