        <section prefix="a">
    	     The interstate commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the by-laws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the “Model State Administrative Procedures Act,” 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the interstate commission deems appropriate, consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding, as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     When promulgating a rule, the interstate commission shall, at a minimum:
        </section>
        <section prefix="1">
    	     publish the proposed rule’s entire text, stating the reasons for such proposed rule;
        </section>
        <section prefix="2">
    	     allow and invite any and all persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record and be made publicly available;
        </section>
        <section prefix="3">
    	     provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by 10 or more persons; and
        </section>
        <section prefix="4">
    	     promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials or interested parties.
        </section>
        <section prefix="d">
    	     Not later than 60 days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the interstate commission’s principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the interstate commission’s action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this section, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.
        </section>
        <section prefix="e">
    	     If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.
        </section>
        <section prefix="f">
    	     The existing rules governing the operation of the interstate compact on juveniles superseded by this chapter shall be null and void 12 months after the first meeting of the interstate commission.
        </section>
        <section prefix="g">
    	     Upon determination by the interstate commission that a state of emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, but the rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to such rule as soon as reasonably possible, but not later than 90 days after the effective date of the emergency rule.
