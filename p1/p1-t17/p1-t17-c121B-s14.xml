        An operating agency may obligate itself, in any contract with the federal government for a loan or the payment of annual contributions authorized by section eleven, to convey to the federal government the project to which such contract relates, upon the occurrence of a substantial default with respect to the covenants, terms and conditions of such contract to which such agency is subject. Such contract may further provide that, in case of such conveyance, the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey or otherwise deal with the project in accordance with the terms of such contract; provided, that the contract shall require that, as soon as practicable, after the federal government is satisfied that all of the defaults on account of which it acquired the project have been remedied, and that the project will thereafter be operated in compliance with the terms of the contract, the federal government shall reconvey to such agency or its successor the project in the condition in which it then exists. The obligation of an operating agency under such contract shall be subject to specific enforcement by any court having jurisdiction, and, notwithstanding any other provision of the law, shall not be deemed to constitute a mortgage.
