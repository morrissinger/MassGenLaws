    <text>
        Whenever the medical director of the Bridgewater state hospital certifies that the failure to retain any person in strict security would not create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness but that such person is in need of further care and treatment in a facility, he shall request the commission to transfer such person to a facility designated by the commissioner. Within thirty days of the receipt of such request the commissioner shall execute the transfer, unless within said period he files a petition under sections seven and eight for the further commitment of the person to the Bridgewater state hospital.
