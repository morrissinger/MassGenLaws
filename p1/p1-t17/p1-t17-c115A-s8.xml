The lease shall remain in full force and effect so long as a chapel for said patients is maintained thereon and so long as it shall be maintained in a physical condition satisfactory to the superintendent and the trustees of said Home. 
The trustees shall select the lessees in each case, and the design and location of each chapel shall be subject to the approval of the trustees. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deprive any patient, regardless of his religious belief, of an equal opportunity to worship in accordance with said belief, and adequate facilities for such worship shall be made available to all patients by the superintendent.
