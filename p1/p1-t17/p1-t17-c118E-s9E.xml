        The secretary of health and human services may apply for authority from the secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to section 1115 of the Social Security Act that authorizes the secretary to waive provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, to implement measures that: (1) change to a later date the time currently provided by federal law for starting the penalty periods for persons who transfer assets for less than fair market value; (2) require excess assets to be spent on health care or other necessary living expenses; (3) to treat annuities similarly to trusts and require the commonwealth to be a beneficiary to the extent of MassHealth benefits provided; and (4) increase look-back periods, for real estate transfers and transfers into irrevocable trusts; provided that any changes implemented as a result of a waiver authorized by this section shall not apply to new applications submitted before the effective date of this section or the effective date of any waiver granted, whichever is later; and provided further, that transfers of assets up to $300,000 from a primary residence shall not be affected by such waiver. The division or the department of elder affairs, as appropriate, may by regulation implement one or more of such measures under the terms and conditions approved by the secretary, provided that the division or the department, as appropriate, shall waive such measures to address hardships as determined by the division or department.
