    <text>
        So long as the emergency finance board, established under section one of chapter forty-nine of the acts of nineteen hundred and thirty-three, is in existence, no city or town shall, without the approval of said board, incur indebtedness for any of the purposes of this chapter which would cause the total amount of its indebtedness for such purposes then outstanding to exceed two and one half per cent of its equalized valuation. If said emergency finance board shall cease to exist, a commission consisting of the attorney general, the state treasurer and the director of the bureau of accounts in the department of corporations and taxation shall exercise the powers given to said emergency finance board by this section and section twenty-four. Said board or commission, as the case may be, shall hold a public hearing upon any matter submitted to it under this section if requested in writing to do so by twenty-five taxable inhabitants of such city or town within three days after the submission of such matter.
