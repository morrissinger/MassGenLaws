        No employable person shall be eligible for aid or assistance under this chapter who willfully fails without good cause, as determined by the department, to maintain his registration for work or to accept a referral to or offer of suitable employment. He shall be required to report to the department information with respect to any job to which he has been referred. The department shall, not less frequently than once every three months, request verification from the division of employment and training of an applicantâ€™s record with that agency. 
No individual shall be considered ineligible for aid or assistance because of failure to comply with the provisions of this section, if such failure is due to illness or disability. In no event shall such failure affect the eligibility of minor children for assistance under this chapter. 
No recipients of assistance under chapter one hundred and eighteen A or recipients of assistance with dependent children under age three years, shall be subject to the provisions of this section; provided, however, that in a two parent household, only one parent shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
