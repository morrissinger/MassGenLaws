        The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable, and if any such provision, or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not be construed to affect the validity or constitutionality of any of the remaining provisions of said chapter or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that this chapter would have been adopted had such invalid or unconstitutional provision not been included therein.
