The recipients may enter into subcontracts to carry out the purposes of the contract with other for-profit or nonprofit organizations. Prior to providing assistance, the department shall find that: (1) the housing would not, by private enterprise alone and without government assistance, be available to lower income families and individuals; (2) the amount of assistance appears to be the minimum amount necessary to make the housing development feasible; (3) with respect to rental housing, the operations of the owner and its articles of organization and by-laws and any changes to either shall be subject to regulation by the department; and (4) the housing shall remain affordable for its useful life as determined by the department. The housing shall be considered affordable if, during the first 40 years after assistance is first provided, substantially all of the assisted units shall be rented to or owned by families and individuals whose income at initial occupancy is not more than 80 per cent of the area median income for the federal housing programs and that thereafter the units shall be rented or sold, subject to such restrictions on appreciation as determined by the department to be reasonable and necessary to maintain long-term affordability, to families or individuals at incomes at or below 100 per cent of the area median income.
