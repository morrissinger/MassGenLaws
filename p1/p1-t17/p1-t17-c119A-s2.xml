    	     In accordance with the provisions of Title IV, Part D of the Social Security Act, the IV-D agency shall provide IV-D services to children and families, whether or not they are recipients of public assistance, to establish, modify, and enforce child support obligations. Said services shall include, through the use of expedited administrative and judicial procedures, the location of obligees and obligors, the establishment of paternity, the establishment, modification, and enforcement of child support orders, including orders for health care coverage, the collection and disbursement of support payments, the enforcement of support orders through civil and criminal proceedings, including criminal contempt and criminal prosecution for failure to pay support, and any other services or responsibilities required by said Title IV, Part D and this chapter. Said IV-D agency shall accept applications for services from individuals seeking to establish, modify, or enforce orders of child support, including orders for health care coverage, with respect to a child who is not a recipient of public assistance, and may charge a fee for such services which shall be established pursuant to the provisions of section 3B of chapter 7, subject to the provisions of federal law.

        <section prefix="b">
    	     The first priority of the IV-D agency with regard to the enforcement of the subrogation rights of the department of transitional assistance shall be the collection of sufficient support payments on behalf of recipients of public assistance to enable such recipients to live independently of public assistance; provided, however, that the department of transitional assistance is authorized to receive support payments made on behalf of a current recipient, or on behalf of a former recipient for arrearages owed to the department of transitional assistance, only to the extent required by the provisions of Title IV, Part D of the Social Security Act.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     In carrying out said responsibilities, the IV-D agency may expend such funds necessary for public information, including paid advertisements and outreach programs to advise the public of the services available through the agency to establish, modify, or enforce orders of child support, and to publicize the availability and to encourage the use of procedures for voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and of other IV-D services. Any penalty, fee or interest that this chapter authorizes to be assessed by the IV-D agency shall be collected and enforced by any means authorized under this chapter for the enforcement and collection of child support. Upon collection, a penalty or fee shall be retained by the IV-D agency; but, the penalty or fee shall be placed in the child support trust fund established pursuant to Upon collection, interest shall be distributed to the individual obligee on whose behalf the collection was made.
