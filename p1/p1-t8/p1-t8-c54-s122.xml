        In each county, except Suffolk and Nantucket, the judge and register of the probate court and the clerk of the courts shall be a board of examiners; and if two of said offices are held by the same person in any county, the sheriff shall be a member of the board. The members of said board shall each be paid at the rate of three dollars a day for every day employed in the performance of their duties and ten cents a mile for travel to and from the place of their meeting; and their accounts shall be audited and settled by the county treasurer. Said board shall meet on the first Wednesday of the month following an election for county commissioners and shall examine such copies, determine what persons appear to be elected, issue certificates of election to them and give notice to the state secretary of the name, residence and number of votes received by each candidate in each city and town, with the name and term of office of every person so elected, and shall, within three days thereafter deposit said copies in the office of the clerk of the courts.
