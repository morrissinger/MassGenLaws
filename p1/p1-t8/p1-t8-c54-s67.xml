        One voting list shall be delivered to the ballot clerks and another to the officer in charge of the ballot box; except that, where voting machines are used, one voting list shall be delivered to the officer at the entrance to the space within the guard rail. When a ballot is delivered to a voter, his name shall be checked on the first voting list and, except where voting machines are used, it shall be checked on the second when he deposits his ballot. Except where voting machines are used, the officer in charge of the ballot box and the officer in charge of the voting list shall be of different political parties. No person shall vote if his name is not on the voting list, nor until the election officer shall check his name thereon, unless he presents a certificate from the registrars of voters as provided by section fifty-one or section fifty-nine of chapter fifty-one, or unless he is voting by provisional ballot under section 76C.
