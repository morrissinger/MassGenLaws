        Proceedings under sections twenty A or twenty A1/2 of this chapter shall not be deemed criminal. Whenever there are outstanding against the registered owner of a motor vehicle more than five unpaid parking violations issued by a city or town, said owner or city or town may apply to the clerk of the division of the district or municipal court having jurisdiction to have the matter of these alleged violations treated criminally, and the district or municipal court shall take jurisdiction of the matter. The matter shall thereafter be deemed criminal and the procedures established for criminal cases be followed, provided, however, that the provisions of the second and third paragraphs of section thirty-five A of chapter two hundred and eighteen shall not apply to such cases. Any such fine imposed by the court shall not exceed double the maximum fine provided for in any city or town. Said fine imposed by the court shall be paid back to the said cities or towns where the violation occurred.
