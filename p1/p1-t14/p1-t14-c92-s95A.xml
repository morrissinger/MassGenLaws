Before the issue of a permit hereunder, the applicant shall file with the commission a bond running to the commission, in such penal sum as the commission shall determine, to indemnify and save harmless the commission and its agents and employees from all claims, loss, damage and expense in any way relating to or connected with such permit. This section shall not apply to signs or other structures projecting into or over the way a distance of less than six inches, nor to poles, wires, conduits and appurtenances of railroad, railway, telegraph and telephone, water, gas, electric light, heat and power companies.
