        The zoos shall continue to be known as the Franklin Park Zoo and the Walter D. Stone Memorial Zoo but the corporation may offer sponsor naming rights to the zoos or exhibits within the zoos and may add sponsor names to the existing names of the zoos or exhibits. The commonwealth shall at all times retain title to all real property and the appurtenances thereon; only the care, custody and control of the zoos shall be transferred to the corporation pursuant to this chapter. The zoos and all real property shall remain a part of the metropolitan parks system. In the event that, for any reason, the corporation dissolves, the commission shall assume responsibility for the zoos and their operation, and all funds, personal property, and animal collections shall revert to the commission.
