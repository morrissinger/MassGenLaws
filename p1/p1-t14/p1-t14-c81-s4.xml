        If county commissioners, aldermen or selectmen adjudge that public necessity and convenience require that the commonwealth lay out and take charge of a new or existing way as a highway in whole or in part, in their county, city or town, they may apply, by a written petition, to the department, requesting that said way be laid out and taken charge of by the commonwealth.
