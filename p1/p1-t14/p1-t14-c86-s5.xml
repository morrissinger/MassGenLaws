    <text>
        Any person may remove gates, rails, bars or fences which are upon or across a public or private way legally laid out, unless they have been placed there to prevent the spread of disease dangerous to the public health, or unless they have been erected or continued by the license of the county commissioners or of the selectmen or road commissioners or of the person for whose use such private way was laid out. A person aggrieved by such removal may apply to the county commissioners, selectmen or road commissioners, respectively, and if upon examination it appears that such gates, rails, bars or fences were erected or continued by such license, they shall order them replaced.
