    <text>
        Any person aggrieved by the failure of the selectmen of a town to lay out suitable landing places therein, after petition therefor, or by the failure of a town to accept a common landing place laid out by the selectmen, may, if an inhabitant of such town or of an adjoining town, within six months after such petition to the selectmen or after such failure of the town, appeal by petition in writing to the county commissioners, who, unless sufficient cause to the contrary is shown, may lay out suitable common landing places, or may approve a landing place laid out by the selectmen, and may direct the laying out of such landing places to be recorded by the clerk of the town, and such laying out or approval shall have the same effect as a laying out by the selectmen and an acceptance by the town. The proceedings of the county commissioners upon such an appeal shall, so far as is practicable, be the same as those provided by law in regard to the laying out of highways by county commissioners.
