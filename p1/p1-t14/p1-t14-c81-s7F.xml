        Whenever the department deems it necessary to make surveys, soundings, drillings or examinations to obtain information for or to expedite the construction of state highways or other projects under its jurisdiction, the department, its authorized agents or employees may, after due notice by registered or certified mail, enter upon any lands, waters and premises, not including buildings, in the commonwealth for the purpose of making surveys, soundings, drillings and examinations as they may deem necessary or convenient for the purposes of this act, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass nor shall an entry for such purposes be deemed an entry under any condemnation proceedings which may be then pending. The department shall make reimbursement for any injury or actual damage resulting to such lands, waters and premises caused by any act of its authorized agents or employees and shall so far as possible restore such lands to the same condition as prior to the making of such surveys, soundings, drillings or examinations.
