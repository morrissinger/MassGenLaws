        Whenever a person after applying for and receiving an identification card acquires an address different from the address shown on the identification card issued to him, he shall, within thirty days thereafter, notify the registrar in writing of his old and new address. The registrar thereupon may take such action as necessary to insure that the identification card reflects the proper address of the identification card holder.
