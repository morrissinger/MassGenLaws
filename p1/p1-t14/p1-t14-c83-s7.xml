        If the department of environmental protection determines upon examination that a filter bed or other works for the treatment, purification and disposal of sewage causes the pollution of a stream, pond or other water, or is likely to become a source of nuisance or create objectionable results in its neighborhood by reason of defective construction, inadequate capacity or negligence or inefficiency in maintenance or operation or from other cause, it may issue notice in writing to the town or person owning or operating such works requiring such enlargement or improvement in the works or change in the method of operation thereof as may be necessary for the proper maintenance and operation of the works and the efficient purification and disposal of the sewage. If said department determines after investigation that the unsatisfactory operation of a sewage disposal system is due wholly or partly to the discharge into the system of manufacturing waste or other substance of such character as to interfere with the efficient operation of said works, it may if necessary prohibit the entrance of such waste or other material, or may regulate the entrance thereof into the system, or may require the treatment of such waste or other material in such manner as may be necessary to prevent its interference with the operation of the works.
