        The registrar shall suspend or revoke a certificate of title, upon notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard in accordance with section thirty, when authorized by any other provision of law, or if he finds that the certificate of title was fraudulently procured or erroneously issued, or that the vehicle has been scrapped, dismantled or destroyed. Suspension or revocation of a certificate of title shall not, in itself, affect the validity of a security interest noted on it. When the registrar suspends or revokes a certificate of title, the owner or person in possession of it shall, immediately upon receiving notice of the suspension or revocation, mail or deliver the certificate to the registrar. The registrar may seize and impound any certificate of title which has been suspended or revoked.
