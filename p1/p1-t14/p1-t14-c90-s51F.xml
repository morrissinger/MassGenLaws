With the approval of the mayor and the city council in cities or the approval of a town meeting, as the case may be, said commission may so let or lease for a longer period; provided, that no such airport in the cities of New Bedford and Beverly shall be let or leased except with the approval of the mayor and the city council, or in the town of Southbridge by vote of the town.
