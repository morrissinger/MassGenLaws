        For the purpose of establishing an airport, the airport commission of a city or town, whenever appropriations have been made therefor, may take property by eminent domain under chapter seventy-nine or chapter eighty A of the General Laws, or may acquire property by purchase, lease or otherwise, both within and without its territorial limits for airport purposes and may so take or acquire such easements in airport hazards outside the boundaries of an airport or airport site as may be necessary for the removal or the prevention of the establishment of any airport hazard. For the purpose of making surveys or examinations relative to any proposed taking by eminent domain, such airport commission or its authorized agent may make a reasonable entry upon land.
