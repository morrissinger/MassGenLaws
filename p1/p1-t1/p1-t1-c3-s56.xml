        [ Text of section effective until January 1, 2013. Repealed by 2012, 165, Sec. 7. See 2012, 165, Sec. 137.]  There is hereby established a legislative research council, hereinafter called the council, to consist of four members of the senate, to be designated annually by the president thereof, and eight members of the house of representatives, to be designated annually by the speaker thereof, who shall serve until their respective successors have been appointed and who may be reappointed; provided, however, that no member shall serve after he ceases to be a member of the general court. The membership appointed to the council from each branch of the general court shall be equally divided between the two major political parties. The president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives shall appoint the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the council. Members of the council shall serve without pay as such but shall be reimbursed for all necessary expenses, and while the general court is not in session shall be reimbursed for travel and expenses to and from their homes to the state house at the same rate as that paid to members of the general court when it is in session. The members of said council shall not be deemed to be executive or administrative officers within the meaning of the constitution, but shall serve directly under the general court.
