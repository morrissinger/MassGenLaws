        [ Text of section effective until January 1, 2013. Repealed by 2012, 165, Sec. 6. See 2012, 165, Sec. 137.]  Except as provided in the two preceding sections, no money shall be paid from the treasury for expenses incurred by committees of the general court unless, at the beginning of each month and at other convenient and necessary times during the session, the clerk of the committee prepares a schedule, on forms furnished by the comptroller, of the expenses incurred for which bills have been rendered, which shall be approved in writing by a majority of the members of the committee and transmitted to the comptroller. If a bill for an authorized expense incurred during a regular or special session of the general court is not rendered during such session so that it can be approved as aforesaid, the written approval of a majority of the members of the committee shall be sufficient to authorize the comptroller to certify it.
