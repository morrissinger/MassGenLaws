        When any consolidation or merger becomes effective as hereinbefore provided, for all purposes of the laws of the commonwealth, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have consolidated or merged, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall be vested in the resulting or surviving domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and shall thereafter be the property of the resulting or surviving domestic limited liability company or other business entity as they were of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have consolidated or merged, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the commonwealth, in any of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have consolidated or merged shall thenceforth attach to the resulting or surviving domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed, a consolidation or merger of a domestic limited liability company, including a domestic limited liability company which is not the resulting or surviving entity in the consolidation or merger, shall not require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs under section forty-five or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under section forty-six.
