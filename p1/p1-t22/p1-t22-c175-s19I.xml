        No director, officer, agent or employee of the reorganizing insurer, or any other person, shall receive any fee, commission or other valuable consideration whatsoever, other than his usual regular salary and compensation, for in any manner aiding, promoting or assisting in such reorganization, except as set forth in the plan of reorganization approved by the commissioner. This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit the payment of reasonable fees and compensation to attorneys at law, accountants and actuaries for services performed in the independent practice of their professions, even though they may be directors of the insurer.
