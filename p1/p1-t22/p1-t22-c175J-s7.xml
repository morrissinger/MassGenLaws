        An insurer placed under administrative supervision by the commissioner may contest the order, or any part of such order, at any time during the supervision by requesting review of the order by the supreme judicial court for Suffolk county. The insurer must demonstrate that the action taken or proposed to be taken by the terms of the order will not result in improving the condition of the insurer, or result in the protection of the insureds or the public in general. Said supreme judicial court for Suffolk county shall review the action complained of in a closed hearing and render its decision at the earliest possible date thereafter. The court may stay the implementation of any such order of the commissioner, pending its review of such order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, filing of a petition for review of such order shall not automatically stay the implementation of the order, or any of its provisions. Review of such order by said supreme judicial court for Suffolk county shall not be considered initiation of judicial proceedings for the purpose of section six of chapter one hundred and seventy-five.
