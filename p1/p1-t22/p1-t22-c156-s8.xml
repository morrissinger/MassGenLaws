A copy of such notice shall, seven days at least before the day appointed for the meeting, be given to each incorporator or left at his residence or usual place of business, or deposited in the post office, postage prepaid, and addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, and another copy thereof, and an affidavit of one of the signers that the notice has been duly served, shall be recorded with the records of the corporation.
