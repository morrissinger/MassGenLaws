    	     An assignee who has become a member has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the operating agreement and this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, an assignee who becomes a member is liable for the obligations of his assignor to make contributions as provided in section twenty-eight, but shall not be liable for the obligations of his assignor under section thirty-five. However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities, including the obligations of his assignor to make contributions as provided in section twenty-eight, unknown to the assignee at the time he became a member and which could not be ascertained from the operating agreement.
