        APPEAL FROM SECRETARY OF STATE’S REFUSAL TO FILE DOCUMENT 
If the secretary of state refuses to file a document delivered to his office for filing, the person attempting to file may appeal that refusal. Such an appeal must be commenced within 90 days after the return of the document to the superior court of the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in the commonwealth, its registered office, is or will be located. Such an appeal is commenced by petitioning the court to compel the filing of the document and by attaching to the petition the document and the explanation of the secretary of state for his refusal to file.
