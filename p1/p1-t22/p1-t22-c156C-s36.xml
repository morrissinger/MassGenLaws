        A member may resign as a member of a limited liability company at the time or upon the happening of events specified in the operating agreement and in accordance with the operating agreement. An operating agreement may provide that a member shall not have the right to resign as a member of a limited liability company. Regardless of whether an operating agreement provides that a member does not have the right to resign as a member of a limited liability company, a member may resign as a member of a limited liability company upon not less than six months’ prior written notice to the limited liability company at its office in the commonwealth as set forth in the certificate of organization filed in the office of the state secretary and to each other member and each manager at each other member’s and each manager’s address as set forth on the records of the limited liability company as of the date of the notice. If the resignation of a member violates the operating agreement, in addition to any remedies otherwise available under applicable law, a limited liability company may recover from the resigning member damages for breach of the operating agreement and offset the damages against any amounts otherwise distributable to the resigning member.
