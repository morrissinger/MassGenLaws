        Deposits standing in the individual name of a deceased depositor of a bank or federally chartered bank shall be paid to his legal representative, but if the deposit does not exceed $10,000 and there has been no demand for payment from a duly appointed executor or administrator, payment may be made, in the discretion of the treasurer or other duly authorized officer of the bank or federally chartered bank, or pursuant to special vote of its board, after the expiration of 30 days from the death of such depositor, to the surviving spouse of said deceased depositor or if there be no surviving spouse, to the next of kin of such deceased upon presentation of a copy of the decedentâ€™s death certificate and the surrender of the deposit book or other instrument, if any, evidencing the deposit. Any such bank or federally chartered bank may pay an order, drawn by a person who has funds on deposit to meet the same, notwithstanding the death of the drawer, if presentation is made within thirty days after the date of such order, and at any time if the corporation has not received written notice of the death of the drawer; provided, however, that in either event, that such funds would, on the date of such payment, have been subject to withdrawal by the drawer if living. Payments made under authority of any provision of this section shall discharge the liability of the bank or federally chartered bank to all persons to the extent of such payments.
