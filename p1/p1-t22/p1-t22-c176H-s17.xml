        The commissioner may, after public hearing, promulgate appropriate rules and regulations for the execution of his duties under this chapter. The rules and regulations may include such provisions as the commissioner deems necessary to assure that legal services plans operate in the public interest, to enable insureds, members and their covered dependents to receive legal services at reasonable cost, and to restrain any inflation in the cost of legal services attributable to the operation of legal services plans.
