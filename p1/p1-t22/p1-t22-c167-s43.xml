        The board of bank incorporation may, subject to such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe, grant to a foreign banking association or corporation whose principal office is in another state, a certificate authorizing it to act in a fiduciary capacity under the provisions, so far as applicable, of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven G; provided, that said association or corporation is authorized so to act by the laws of the state where its principal office is located; and provided further, that the laws of such state grant a similar privilege or privileges to like associations or corporations having their principal office in this commonwealth. Any such banking association or corporation holding a certificate as aforesaid and appointed a fiduciary shall be subject to the provisions of general law with respect to the appointment of agents by foreign fiduciaries and to the same taxes, obligations and penalties, with respect to its activities as such fiduciary and the property held by it in its fiduciary capacity, as like associations or corporations having their principal office in this commonwealth, and no such certificate shall be issued to any such banking association or corporation until it has filed with the said board of bank incorporation an agreement in writing in which it binds itself to perform said obligations and pay any such taxes and penalties as aforesaid as may be levied or imposed upon it in this commonwealth. Such a corporation or association, to the extent only that it acts as fiduciary as hereinbefore authorized, shall not be deemed to transact business in the commonwealth for the purposes of sections thirty-eight to forty-two, inclusive.
