    	     If a corporation does not allow a shareholder who complies with section 16.02(a) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the superior court of the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in the commonwealth, its registered office is located may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation’s expense upon application of the shareholder.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     If a corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a shareholder to inspect and copy any other record, the shareholder who complies with subsections (b) and (c) of section 16.02 may apply to the superior court in the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in the commonwealth, its registered office is located for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded under section 16.02, it shall also order the corporation to pay the shareholder’s costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the shareholder to inspect the records demanded; and the court may order the corporation to pay the shareholder’s costs if it orders inspection and copying of records other than under section 16.02.
        </section>
        <section prefix="d">
    	     If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding shareholder.
