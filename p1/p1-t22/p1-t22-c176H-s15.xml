        Upon application to the superior court by the commissioner, injunctive relief may be granted if any sponsor of an insured legal services plan or a membership legal services plan has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter; is operating fraudulently; is operating so as to render further operations contrary to the public interest; has exceeded its powers; has violated any provision of law; is financially unable to pay its claims in full; or is insolvent. The court may forthwith issue a temporary injunction restraining the transaction of any business, and it may, after a full hearing make the injunction permanent, and appoint one or more receivers to take possession of the books, papers, monies and other assets of the sponsor to settle its affairs, and distribute its funds to those entitled thereto, subject to such rules and orders as the court may prescribe, or may make such other order as it may deem appropriate.
