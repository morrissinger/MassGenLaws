        In the event temporary approval for transfer under the Interstate Commerce Act has been granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission and upon application and payment of the fees required by section eleven, the department may, after hearing and upon a finding that such action is otherwise consistent with this chapter, conditionally transfer to the person so authorized thereunder for a period of six months or less, or for any further period authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the department, any interstate license issued under section ten and which is covered by such temporary approval, and any other certificates or permits held by the proposed transferor. After a final order has been issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing a permanent transfer and upon application and payment of the fees required by section eleven, the department may permanently transfer such certificate, permit or license in proceedings held in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
