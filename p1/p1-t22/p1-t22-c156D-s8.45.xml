        CERTIFICATE OF CHANGE IN OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS 
Whenever any change is made in the directors or in the president, treasurer or secretary of a corporation, the corporation shall forthwith file in the office of the state secretary a certificate of the change signed under the penalties of perjury by the clerk or an assistant clerk. If a corporation fails or refuses to file such a certificate within the 30-day period following a change in the directors or in the officers, any director or officer involved in the change, or the personal representative of any deceased director or office so involved, may evidence the change by filing a certificate thereof with the office of the state secretary, signed under the penalties or perjury, including a statement that a copy of the certificate has been delivered to the corporation or has been mailed to the principal office of the corporation, postage prepaid.
