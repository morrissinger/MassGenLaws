Sections one hundred and sixty-two to one hundred and seventy-seven D, inclusive, shall apply to the representatives of exchanges; provided, that an attorney in fact, or, if the attorney in fact is a corporation, an officer thereof, may, without a license as agent, act for such exchange in the negotiation of any contracts of insurance, which it may lawfully make, or in the negotiation of the continuance or renewal of such contracts. Exchanges authorized to transact the business of workersâ€™ compensation insurance in the commonwealth shall be subject to the provisions of sections fifty-two to sixty-five M, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and fifty-two unless said provisions and their context clearly show that said provisions were not intended to apply to the plan and method of exchanging reciprocal or inter-insurance contracts; provided, that a foreign exchange may elect to come under either section fifty-seven or sections sixty-one and sixty-two of said chapter one hundred and fifty-two; and provided, further, that all such exchanges shall be members of and participate in the non-stock pool.
