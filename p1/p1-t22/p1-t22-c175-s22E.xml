    <text>
        No insurance company, and no officer or agent thereof in its behalf, shall refuse to issue, renew or execute as surety a motor vehicle liability policy or bond, or any other insurance based on the ownership or operation of a motor vehicle because of age, sex, race, occupation, marital status, or principal place of garaging of the vehicle. A particular company may make a general reduction in volume of automobile insurance in the commonwealth if such a reduction is determined by the commissioner not to be an attempt to circumvent the purposes of this section and that the companyâ€™s refusal to write motor vehicle liability policies or bonds is not contrary to the public interest by disrupting the market for said insurance in the commonwealth. Any company which does not intend to issue a renewal policy shall give written notice of its intent not to issue a policy for the ensuing policy period in accordance with the provisions of section one hundred and thirteen F and such notice shall specify the reasons for such nonrenewal.
