        To execute and perform the powers and duties conferred upon him, the commissioner may, in the name of any such bank, prosecute and defend all suits and other legal proceedings and may, in the name of the bank, execute, acknowledge and deliver all deeds, assignments, releases and other instruments necessary and proper to effectuate any sale of real or personal property or any compromise authorized by the court, and any deed or other instrument, executed pursuant to the authority hereby given, shall be valid and effectual for all purposes to the same extent as though executed by the officers of the bank by authority of its board of directors or of its stockholders, or by the individual banker personally. In case any of the real property so sold is located in a county other than that where the application to the court for leave to sell the same is made, the commissioner shall cause a certified copy of the order or decree of the court authorizing or ratifying such sale to be filed in the registry of deeds for the district wherein said real property lies.
