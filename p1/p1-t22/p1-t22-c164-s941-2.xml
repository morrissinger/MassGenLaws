    	     Notwithstanding the provisions of section ninety-four or any other law to the contrary, the rates and terms for the sale of compressed natural gas by a fueling station for use as a motor vehicle fuel shall not be subject to regulation by the department; provided, however, that any gas company which sells compressed natural gas for use as a motor vehicle fuel shall keep separate records, books, and accounts of such unregulated sales which are sufficient to allow the department to allocate costs and revenues; and provided, further, that such gas company’s sale of compressed natural gas for use as a motor vehicle fuel and its investment in related infrastructure shall not reduce the availability or increase the cost of natural gas to said company’s customers who purchase natural gas for use other than as a motor vehicle fuel.
