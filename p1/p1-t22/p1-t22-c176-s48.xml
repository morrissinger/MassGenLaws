        No society doing business in the commonwealth shall make or permit any unfair discrimination between insured members of the same class and equal expectation of life in the premiums charged for certificates of insurance, in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the terms and conditions of the contracts it makes. 
No society, by itself, or any other party, and no agent or solicitor, personally, or by any other party, shall offer, promise, allow, give, set off, or pay, directly or indirectly, any valuable consideration or inducement to, or for insurance, on any risk authorized to be taken by such society, which is not specified in the certificate. No member shall receive or accept, directly or indirectly, any rebate of premium, or part thereof, or agent’s or solicitor’s commission thereon, payable on any certificate, or receive or accept any favor or advantage or share in the dividends or other benefits to accrue on, or any valuable consideration or inducement not specified in, the contract of insurance.
