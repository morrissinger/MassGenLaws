1. It has failed to comply with the provisions of its charter, or 
2. It is being operated for profit, or 
3. It is fraudulently conducted, or 
4. Its condition is such as to render its further transaction of business hazardous to the public or to its subscribers, or 
5. Its officers and agents have refused to submit to an examination under section ten, or 
6. It has exceeded its powers, or 
7. It has violated any provision of law,
