        If the selectmen consider it necessary, for the protection of persons and property in their town against fire, to take water from the conductors or pipes therein of an aqueduct corporation, they may direct the engineers of the fire department to request the corporation to put into such conductors or pipes, in such places as said engineers shall think necessary, connections or conductors for the purpose of attaching hydrants or conducting water into reservoirs. If the corporation refuses or neglects for two weeks after such request to comply therewith, said engineers may make such connections at the cost of the town, using all necessary means for making the same and using reasonable care for the protection of the pipes and works of such corporation.
