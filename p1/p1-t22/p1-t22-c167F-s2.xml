6. To invest such amount not exceeding 10 per cent of its capital stock, surplus account, and undivided profits for a stock corporation and not exceeding 10 per cent of its surplus account for a thrift institution or any other such amount which may be authorized under 12 USC section 618, whichever is the greater, as the commissioner may approve in the capital stock of one or more corporations organized under the laws of the United States for the purpose of engaging in international or foreign banking or other internal or foreign financial operations, or in banking or other financial operations in a dependency or insular possession of the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; 
7. To invest subject to the approval of the commissioner and under such limitations or conditions as he may impose, in the capital stock or shares of one or more wholly owned subsidiary corporations, limited liability corporations or trusts or such other forms of organization permitted by the commissioner, organized and operated solely for the purpose of performing functions that the bank itself is empowered to perform directly; 
7A. To invest, subject to the approval of the commissioner and under such limitations or conditions as he may impose, in the capital stock or shares of a subsidiary corporation or trust which is treated as a real estate mortgage investment conduit pursuant to the provisions of 26 USC 860D. 
8. Such corporation may make any investment not otherwise eligible under any other provision of this chapter or any other provision of law including, but not limited to, investment in any capital stock of a corporation organized for the purpose of acquiring and managing interests in real property and acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating, leasing, financing and disposing of housing facilities, or in any other interest in real or personal property or activities incidental thereto, debt security, equity security, loan or community benefits; provided, however, that (a) not more than seven percent of the deposits of such corporation shall be invested pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph; and provided, further, that any amount in excess of three percent of said seven percent shall be invested by such corporation in the following manner: (i) in the capital stock of a corporation organized for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating, leasing, financing and disposing of housing facilities; (ii) for the purpose of micro-lending in the area of small business, including the fishing industry, and farm loans; and (iii) for the purpose of providing technical assistance to nonprofit housing corporations, small businesses and farms for the purpose of establishing credit worthiness; (b) no investment shall be made by such corporation in the equity securities of any one issuer pursuant to this paragraph if the aggregate amount invested by it in the equity securities of such issuer pursuant to this paragraph together with the amount invested in such securities pursuant to any other provision of law exceeds, or by the making of such investment will exceed, two percent of the deposits of such corporation, and no investment shall be made by such corporation in a loan to, or the debt securities of, any one issuer pursuant to this paragraph, if the aggregate amount invested by it pursuant to this paragraph together with the amount invested in a loan to, or in the debt securities, of such issuer pursuant to any other provision of law exceeds two percent of the deposits of such corporation; (c) any loan made or debt security purchased pursuant to this paragraph shall be secured over the term of the loan or the debt security; (d) this paragraph shall not be deemed to alter any provision of this chapter or other provision of law limiting the aggregate amount that may be invested in any class of loan or investment, except for (ii) and (iii), above, which shall be in addition to any such provision of this chapter or other provision of law; and (e) investments authorized solely by this paragraph shall not be deemed investments in which savings banks may legally invest for the purposes of any other provision of law which restricts investments to those in which savings banks may legally invest. 
9. To purchase, hold and lease real estate suitable for the transaction of its business; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount invested and proposed to be invested therein, including the cost of alterations and additions in the nature of permanent fixtures exceeds, directly or indirectly, thirty percent of its capital stock and surplus account or one hundred percent of its capital stock whichever is greater, for a stock corporation or if such amount exceeds one hundred percent of surplus for a thrift institution such excess investment shall be made only with the approval of the commissioner. The amount of any mortgage on real estate owned by a bank directly or indirectly and used by it in whole or in part for the transaction of its business and the amount of money invested by a bank in the securities of any corporation, trust or other organization which holds real estate used in whole or in part for the transaction of the business of such bank or intended for such use, shall be included in determining the amount of real estate that may be held by such bank under this section; 
Any sums that may be recovered by a bank through the sale or other disposal of real estate or any part thereof held under this section, together with such sums as are allowable for ordinary depreciation under the provisions of the federal income tax law, and such additional sums as are taken on account of depreciation or obsolescence, or for other reason shall, with the consent of the commissioner or at his direction, be deducted from the amount considered to be invested in such real estate; 
10. To invest an amount to be approved by the commissioner, subject to such regulations, if any, as he may deem necessary, in a corporation or association formed for the purpose of furnishing to such bank, or to other banks as hereinafter provided, statistical or bookkeeping services or information of the kind generally required by a bank. A bank may also, in participation with any other bank or national banking association, invest its deposits in such corporation or association, subject however to the same approval and regulation, if any, as above provided. The provisions of section two of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven shall apply to such corporations or associations. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude a bank from renting or subscribing for the services of such corporations or association or any other corporation or association rendering such services; 
11. To consent to any settlement, modification or readjustment of any investment in securities legally made by such corporation, and to accept and hold as investments bonds, notes, stocks and other securities offered in full or partial settlement, modification or readjustment of any such investment, pursuant to a reorganization or otherwise; 
12. To act as trustee or custodian under a retirement plan or individual retirement account which in the judgment of such corporation at the time such trustee or custodian is accepted, is established pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 87-792 entitled “Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962”, Public Law 93-406 entitled “Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974”, section 152 of Public Law 95-600 entitled “Revenue Act of 1978”, or sections 311 and 312 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 Public Law 97-34, or pursuant to the provisions of sections 235 through 249, inclusive, of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 Public Law 97-248, if the provisions of said plan have been approved by the commissioner and permit any of the funds of said trust or custodial account to be invested in savings deposits or time deposits of said bank. No funds held by said bank as trustee or custodian shall be invested otherwise than in bank deposits, properly qualified life insurance retirement income policies or other investments authorized by law for banks, or any combination thereof as such plan may prescribe or permit.

No funds held as a trustee shall be invested otherwise than in bank deposits or other legal investments for banks or any combination thereof, as may be prescribed by the trust instrument; 
14. To issue or participate with other persons in the issuance of mortgage-backed securities which are guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States or by an agency of the United States and are backed in whole or in part by mortgages held by such corporation, and may sell, assign or transfer to the United States or any agency of the United States any mortgage loan or interest in any mortgage loan held by such corporation; and in connection therewith such corporation may enter into and perform such agreements relating to the custody and servicing of such mortgages and to other matters as may be required pursuant to applicable regulations of any such agency.

15. To issue or participate with other persons in the issuance of securities representing units of interest in specific mortgage loans or pools or mortgage loans held by such corporation or other issuer, and in connection therewith may enter into and perform such arrangements relating to the custody and servicing of such mortgages and to other related matters, including without limitation provisions for guaranteeing collection or payment of the principal and interest on such securities, as may be found necessary and appropriate by the board of investment or applicable committee of such corporation; provided, however, that the commissioner may from time to time promulgate regulations governing the terms and conditions upon which any such securities may be issued; 
16. To purchase by itself or with other banks group life insurance on the lives of debtors who request such insurance. The premium for such insurance, or the premium on an individual life insurance policy held to cover the indebtedness, may be added to the payments required of those who elect to become insured. In the event of the death of any debtor so insured, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness to the extent of such payment.

No trustee, director, officer or employee of such bank or group of banks shall benefit financially, directly or indirectly from the sale of such insurance; 
A bank which has purchased such group accident and health insurance shall send written notice to each such insured debtor thirty days prior to the effective date of any amendment to or cancellation of such insurance. Such notice shall be sent by mail to the last known address of the debtor and shall clearly state the effect such amendment or cancellation will have on the insured debtor. Such notice shall also be given by an advertisement in newspapers published daily or weekly and of general distribution in cities and towns in which the bank has an office, or if there be no such newspaper, then in a newspaper published in the county wherein the city or town is situated and of general distribution. Such notice shall be published at least seven days prior to the effective date of the amendment or cancellation and shall clearly state the effect on the insured debtors. 
18. To indemnify its directors, trustees, officers, employees and other agents to whatever extent specified in or authorized by a by-law adopted pursuant to law. Such indemnification may include payment by the bank of expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person indemnified to repay such payment if he shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to indemnification under this section. Any such indemnification may be provided although the person to be indemnified is no longer an officer, director, trustee, employee or agent of the bank; 
No indemnification shall be provided for any person with respect to any matter as to which he shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interests of the bank; 
A bank shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer, employee or other agent of the bank, against any liability incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the bank would have the power to indemnify him against such liability;

In the event that federal or out-of-state banks lose the authority to exercise any power or engage in any activity based upon which comparable authority was granted to state chartered banks pursuant to this section, then unless such authority is authorized by another law of the commonwealth, or a rule, regulation or policy adopted pursuant to such other law of the commonwealth, or by a judicial decision, the commissioner shall revoke the authority or power for state chartered banks pursuant to this section. In determining whether or not to authorize any such activity, the commissioner shall also determine whether or not competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably affected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted. The commissioner shall prescribe from time to time such regulations as may be necessary in carrying out the provisions of this paragraph. Except for emergency regulations adopted pursuant to section two of chapter thirty A, any such regulation, or any amendment or repeal thereof, shall, after compliance with all applicable provisions of chapter thirty A except section five, be submitted to the general court. 
The commissioner shall file the proposed regulation, amendment or repeal with the clerk of the house of representatives, together with a statement that the pertinent provisions of said chapter thirty A have been complied with and a summary of the regulations in layman’s terms.
