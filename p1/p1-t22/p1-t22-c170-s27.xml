        Subject to the written approval of the commissioner, any co-operative bank may be dissolved and liquidate its affairs if authorized by a vote passed, at a meeting specially called to consider the subject, by at least two-thirds of the shareholders in a co-operative bank. A committee of three shareholders shall thereupon be elected, and, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the commissioner, shall liquidate the assets, and after satisfying all debts of the corporation shall distribute the remaining proceeds among those entitled thereto in proportion to their respective interests therein.
