Such retirement association shall be formed when its by-laws have been approved and agreed to by a majority of the trustees of each of 15 or more cooperative banks and have been approved by the commissioner. The association shall annually, on or before August 1 report to the commissioner such statements of its membership and financial transactions for the year ending on the preceding December 31st as the commissioner may consider necessary to show its business and standing.
