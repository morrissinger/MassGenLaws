    <text>
        Any credit union may cause any stock or security in registered form held for its account and not in a fiduciary capacity to be registered and held in the name of a partnership or corporate nominee named by it and residing or having a principal place of business in the commonwealth; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as to permit any credit union to deliver any security held for its account into the possession and control of any other person except in accordance with the regulations of the commissioner pursuant to section six of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven. A depository having possession of securities of a credit union registered as authorized by this section shall maintain adequate records indicating the ownership thereof, shall segregate the same from his or its own assets and shall be absolutely liable for any loss occasioned by the acts of a nominee.
