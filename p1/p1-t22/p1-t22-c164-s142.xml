        The department shall continue to remove any impediments to the development of efficient, low-emissions distributed generation, including combined heat and power, taking into account the need to appropriately allocate any associated costs in a fair and equitable manner. For the purposes of this section, “efficient, low-emissions” shall mean an efficiency of 60 per cent or greater on an annual basis and emissions lower than required by the department of environmental protection.
