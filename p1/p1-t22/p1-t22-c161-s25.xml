The department, in authorizing the issue of any bonds under this section, may prescribe the minimum price at which such bonds shall be sold, and may modify such price from time to time, as it deems proper. Whenever it authorizes or has approved the issue or sale of bonds of a face value in excess of the amount determined by it to have been properly expended or to be properly required, it may, in its order of approval, or at any time thereafter, require the company issuing such bonds to establish a sinking fund, estimated to realize at the maturity of said bonds a sum equal to the difference between the amounts for which such bonds were authorized or approved, and the face value of the bonds so authorized or approve therefor, and may designate a domestic trust company as trustee and custodian of such fund, and may from time to time change such trustee. Any agreement relative to said sinking fund, made between the street railway company and the trust company selected as such trustee, shall not be valid until approved by the department.
