        The purpose of this chapter is to subject certain insurers to the jurisdiction of courts of the commonwealth in suits by or on behalf of insureds or beneficiaries under insurance contracts. The legislature declares that it is a subject of concern that many residents of this commonwealth hold policies of insurance issued or delivered in this commonwealth by insurers while not authorized to do business in the commonwealth, thus presenting to such residents the often insuperable obstacle of resorting to distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights under such policies. In furtherance of such state interest, the legislature herein provides a method of substituted service of process upon such insurers and declares that in so doing it exercises its power to protect its residents and to define, for the purpose of this statute, what constitutes doing business in this commonwealth, and also exercises powers and privileges available to the commonwealth by virtue of Public Law 15, 79th Congress of the United States, chapter 20, 1st Sess., S. 340, as amended, which declares that the business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several states.
