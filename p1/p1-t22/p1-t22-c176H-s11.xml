        The commissioner may, upon not less than fifteen daysâ€™ written notice to all interested parties, hold a public hearing upon an insured legal services plan or a membership legal services plan previously approved by him under section five or section nine of this chapter to determine whether modification of any provisions of such a plan or rescission of his prior approval may be necessary in order to protect the interests of the insureds, members or covered dependents of such a plan. The advisory committee on prepaid legal services shall be a party with respect to any plan which is the subject of a hearing under this section, shall have the right to participate in any hearing held hereunder, and shall receive notice of any order or decision of the commissioner issued thereon. After hearing, upon his finding that it is necessary in order to protect the interests of the insureds, members or covered dependents of a plan, the commissioner may modify any provisions of a plan or rescind his prior approval thereof. 
No insured legal services plan or membership legal services plan may be the subject of a hearing under this section except after three years from the date of approval of the plan by the commissioner under section five or section nine of this chapter or except after three years from the date of any order or decision of the commissioner after a hearing upon such a plan under this section.
