        The directors of a corporation may, subject to section forty-two of chapter one hundred and fifty-five and to the by-laws of the corporation, determine the conditions upon which a new certificate of stock may be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost or destroyed. They may, in their discretion, require the owner of a lost or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give a bond with sufficient surety to the corporation in a sum not exceeding double the market value of the stock to indemnify the corporation against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issue of a certificate in place of such lost or destroyed stock certificate.
