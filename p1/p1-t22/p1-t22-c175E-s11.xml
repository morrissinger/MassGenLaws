        The commissioner may once in each calendar year establish rules by which the companies shall produce an information guide which outlines in language prescribed or approved by the commissioner the various choices of coverage available to insureds and an approximation of differences in cost among various types of coverage and among competing carriers. Each company shall bear full responsibility for assuring that a copy of such information guide is forwarded to every person insured or solicited for insurance by that company or its agents.
