        </section>
        <section prefix="1">
    	     invest in capital stock of one or more subsidiaries of the type authorized in this chapter, additional amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent of such insurer’s assets or fifty percent of such insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments, the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

        </section>
        <section prefix="i">
    	     total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of noninsurer subsidiaries, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such noninsurance subsidiaries; and (ii) all amounts expended in acquiring additional capital stock and all contributions to the capital or surplus of noninsurance subsidiaries subsequent to their acquisition or formation;

    	     Invest any amount in capital stock of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, however, provided that each such subsidiary limits its investments in any asset so that such investment in such assets pursuant to this clause will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed the applicable investment limitation contained in the section under which such investment would otherwise be held by the insurer pursuant to the applicable provisions of sections sixty-three to sixty-six E, inclusive, subsection (a) of section two hundred and six A and paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of section two hundred and six A.

        </section>
        <section prefix="3">
    	     With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in capital stock of one or more subsidiaries of the types authorized for investment by this chapter, provided that after such investment the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders and its asset valuation reserve are reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before such investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the value of all previous investments in capital stock of subsidiaries acquired subject to the limitations of said subsection (b) as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.
        </section>
        <section prefix="d">
    	     If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of the investment in the capital stock made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after such investment shall have been made, such investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this chapter or is otherwise lawful, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.
