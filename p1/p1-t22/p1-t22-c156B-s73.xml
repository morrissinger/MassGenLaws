Such power and authority may be exercised, and such proceedings and acts may be taken, as may be directed by such decrees or orders, by the trustee or trustees of such corporation appointed by the court in the reorganization proceedings (or a majority thereof), or if none be appointed and acting, by designated officers of the corporation, or by a master or other representative appointed by the court, with like effect as if exercised and taken by unanimous action of the directors and stockholders of the corporation.
