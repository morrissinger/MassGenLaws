        No corporation organized under general laws for the purpose of fostering, encouraging or engaging in athletic exercises or for the establishment and maintenance of places for reading rooms, libraries or social meetings, or organized under this chapter for the purpose of maintaining grounds suitable for exhibitions and trials of the speed or strength of horses, shall change its location from the town where it is located to another town within the commonwealth, nor change its location within any town, until written consent therefor has been obtained from the police commissioner in Boston, the aldermen in any other city or the selectmen in the town where the corporation proposes to acquire a new location. Such consent shall not take effect until a copy thereof, duly attested by the clerk or secretary of the board or officer consenting thereto, has been filed in the office of the state secretary. A change of location by a corporation contrary to this section shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of its charter by the state secretary.
