        In applying and construing this chapter, consideration shall be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act. To the extent that any provision of the law, rule or regulation is in conflict with this chapter, specifically to the extent that any such conflict would operate to defeat or otherwise interfere with the purposes of this chapter, this chapter shall supersede and take precedence over any such law, rule or regulation. This act shall be construed to the maximum extent possible so as to not constitute an impairment of contract.
