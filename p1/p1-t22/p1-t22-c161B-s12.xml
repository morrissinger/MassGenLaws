In making such audits, said auditor may call upon any of the departments, commissions, officers and agencies of the commonwealth for such information as may be needed in the course of making such audits. The state auditor may employ such auditors, accountants and other assistants as he deems necessary for carrying out his duties under this section, and chapter thirty-one and the rules made thereunder shall not apply to such employees. The commonwealth shall be reimbursed by the authority for the cost of the audit. 
A copy of each biennial audit shall be provided to the chairs of the senate and house committees on ways and means and the senate and house chairs of the joint committee on bonding, capital expenditures and state assets.
