        Whenever any change is made in the directors or in the president, treasurer or clerk of a corporation, the corporation shall forthwith file in the office of the state secretary a certificate of such change signed under the penalties of perjury by the clerk or an assistant clerk. Any corporation which omits to file a certificate as aforesaid within thirty days after such change has been made or shall fail to have either a clerk of the corporation who is a resident of the commonwealth or a resident agent appointed pursuant to section forty-nine shall forfeit not more than five hundred dollars to be recovered in the manner described by section one hundred and thirteen. If a corporation fails or refuses to file such a certificate within said thirty-day period following a change in the directors or in said officers, any director or officer involved in such change, or the personal representative of any deceased director or officer so involved, may evidence such change by filing a certificate thereof with the office of the state secretary, signed under the penalties of perjury, including a statement that a copy of the certificate has been delivered to the corporation or has been mailed to the principal office of the corporation, postage prepaid.
