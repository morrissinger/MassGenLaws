Its award shall be binding upon the parties thereto for five years, and thereafter until it is revised or altered by the department, and upon the written request of a party affected thereby, filed within thirty days after the rendering thereof, the award shall be filed in the supreme judicial court which shall have jurisdiction to revise the same as if the award had been made by a commission appointed by said court.
