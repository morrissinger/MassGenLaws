        If the commissioner refuses to issue a license, he shall notify the applicant of the denial, and within twenty days thereafter, he shall enter upon his records a written decision and findings containing the reasons supporting the denial and shall forthwith give written notice thereof by registered mail to the applicant. Within thirty days after the date of such notice, the applicant may appeal such denial to the superior court sitting in the county in which the business of the applicant is located. The court shall hear all pertinent evidence, determine the facts and, upon the facts as so determined, review such denial and affirm the same or order the commissioner to issue such license, as justice and equity may require.
