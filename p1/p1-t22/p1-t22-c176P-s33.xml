        A domestic society may provide that the meetings of its legislative or governing body may be held in any state or province wherein such society has subordinate branches, and all business transacted at such meetings shall be as valid in all respects as if such meetings were held in the commonwealth. Its principal office shall, however, be situated in this commonwealth.
