        An insurer issuing a reimbursement insurance policy shall not terminate the policy until a notice of termination has been mailed or delivered to the commissioner. The termination of a reimbursement insurance policy shall not reduce the issuerâ€™s responsibility for service contracts issued by providers prior to the date of the termination.
