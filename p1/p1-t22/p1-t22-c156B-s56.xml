        Meetings of the directors may be held within or without the commonwealth. Unless otherwise provided by the by-laws, regular meetings of the directors, including the first meeting of the board following the annual meeting of the stockholders, may be held without notice if the time and place of such meetings are fixed by the by-laws or by the board. Special meetings of the directors shall be held only upon notice to the directors.
