        A railroad corporation may, with the consent of a canal corporation, alter the course of a canal or of a feeder to a canal, which interferes with the convenient location of its railroad. If it is necessary to take land for such alteration, the railroad corporation may take the same under chapter seventy-nine and shall immediately convey the property so taken to the canal corporation.
