    <text>
        If after any hearing under sections six or ten the report of the commissioner does not charge a violation of this chapter, then any intervenor in the proceedings may within thirty days after the service of such report, cause a petition to be filed in the supreme judicial court for a review of such report. Upon such review, the court shall have authority to issue appropriate orders and decrees in connection therewith, including, if the court finds that it is to the interest of the public, orders enjoining and restraining the continuance of any method of competition, act or practice which it finds, notwithstanding such report of the commissioner, constitutes a violation of this chapter and containing penalties pursuant to section seven.
