        The by-laws shall contain clear and distinct provisions relative to the election, admission and expulsion of members; the titles, duties, powers and tenure of the officers of the corporation and their election and removal; the number of members required for a quorum; the call for special meetings; the adoption, amendment and repeal of by-laws; the purposes to which the funds of the corporation may be applied and for which assessments may be laid upon the members; the conditions upon which a member or persons dependent upon a deceased member shall be entitled to benefits, if any are to be given by the corporation; the imposition of fines and forfeitures, if any; the deposit, investment and custody of the funds of the corporation; the periodical audit of the accounts of the treasurer; except that such by-laws may not restrict the right of the members thereof to offer nominations from the floor at the annual meeting of the corporation, nor prevent any member thereof from receiving a copy of the by-laws upon written request, but may require that for such nominations from the floor to be valid a notice signed by not less than seven members, giving the names of such nominees, be first filed with the corporation’s recording officer not later than ten days prior to the date of the annual meeting. If pursuant to the by-laws, the report of a nominating committee is sent to the members at least thirty days prior to the date of the annual meeting, the by-laws may require, instead of the foregoing requirement, that the notice of nominations be first filed with the corporation’s recording officer within twenty days after the nominating committee’s report is sent out. A by-law shall not be repealed or amended, or an additional by-law adopted, unless notice of such proposed action shall have been given at a previous meeting; and such repeal, amendment or adoption shall not take effect until it has been approved by the state secretary as conformable to law.
