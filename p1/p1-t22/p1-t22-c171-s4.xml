    <text>
        The first meeting of the incorporators shall be called by a notice signed either by the incorporator who is designated in the agreement for the purpose or by a majority of the incorporators, and such notice shall state the time, place and purposes of the meeting. A copy of the notice shall, at least seven days before the day appointed for the meeting, be given to each incorporator or left at his residence or usual place of business or deposited in the post office, postage prepaid, and addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, and another copy thereof and an affidavit of one of the signers that the notice has been duly served shall be recorded with the records of the corporation. If all of the incorporators shall, in writing endorsed upon the agreement of association, waive such notice and fix the time and place of the meeting, no such notice shall be required. At such first meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the incorporators shall organize by the choice by ballot of a temporary clerk who shall be sworn, by the adoption of by-laws and by the election in such manner as the by-laws may determine, of directors, a clerk or secretary, and such other officers as the by-laws may prescribe. The temporary clerk shall make and attest a record of the proceedings until the clerk or secretary has been chosen and sworn, including a record of such choice and qualification.
