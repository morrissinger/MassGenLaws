        No group annuity contract, nor the proceeds or benefits thereof, shall be liable, either before or after payment, to be seized, taken, appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable process or operation of law to pay any debt or liabilities of the annuitant or his beneficiary or any other person having any right thereunder; nor shall the benefits or proceeds upon the death of an annuitant, when not made payable to a beneficiary, constitute a part of the estate of the annuitant for the payment of his debts. 
Nothing in this section shall prevent an annuitantâ€™s benefits from being seized, taken, appropriated, assigned, or applied by any legal or equitable process or operation of law to satisfy a support order under chapter two hundred and eight, two hundred and nine, or two hundred and seventy-three.
