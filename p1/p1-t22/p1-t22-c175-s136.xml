        Such policies shall be exempt from any loan provision or requirement. Any equity of the insured in a group life insurance policy at the time of default in the payment of a premium, whether that equity exists by reason of the terms of the policy or by law, shall be applied to purchase extended or paid-up insurance for each of the insured at attained age on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in computing the premium for the group.
