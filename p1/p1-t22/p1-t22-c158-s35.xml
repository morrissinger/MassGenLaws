        Every corporation may determine by its by-laws what number of stockholders shall attend, either in person or by proxy, or what number of shares or amount of interest shall be represented at any meeting, to constitute a quorum. If the quorum is not so determined, a majority in interest of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum.
