        <section prefix="a">
    	     A director of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy the books, records and documents of the corporation at any reasonable time to the extent reasonably related to the performance of the director’s duties as a director, including duties as a member of a committee, but not for any other purpose or in any manner that would violate any duty to the corporation.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     If a corporation does not allow a director who purports to be entitled thereto pursuant to subsection (a) of section 16.05 to inspect and copy any books, records or documents required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the superior court of the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in the commonwealth, its registered office is located may order inspection and copying of the books, records and documents demanded at the corporation’s expense upon application of the director, unless the corporation establishes that the director is not entitled to such inspection rights. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     If the court orders inspection and copying of the books, records and documents demanded, it may include provisions protecting the corporation from undue burden or expense, and prohibiting the director from using information obtained upon exercise of the inspection rights in a manner that would violate a duty to the corporation, and may also order the corporation to pay the director’s costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred in connection with the application.
