Such information shall include, but not be limited to:  (1) the filing materials submitted to be registered as a provider organization, pursuant to chapter 6D;  (2) a list of all carriers and public health payers with which the provider organization has entered into alternative payment contracts with downside risk;  (3) financial statements showing the risk-bearing provider organization's assets, liabilities, reserves and sources of working capital and other sources of financial support and projections of the results of operations for the succeeding 3 years;  (4) a financial plan, including a statement indicating the anticipated timing for receipt of income from alternative payment contracts with downside risk versus the incurrence of expenses, a statement of the applicant's plan to establish and maintain sufficient reserves or other resources that will protect the risk-bearing provider organization from the potential losses from downside risk, copies of insurance or other agreements which protect the risk-bearing provider organization from potential losses from downside risk, and a detailed description of mechanisms to monitor the financial solvency of any provider organization subcontracting with the applicant that assumes downside risk in its alternative payment arrangement with the risk-bearing provider organization;  (5) a utilization plan describing the methods by which the risk-bearing provider organization will monitor inpatient and outpatient utilization under the alternative payment contracts with downside risk;  (6) an actuarial certification that, after examining the terms of all the risk-bearing provider organization's alternative payment contracts with downside risk that the alternate payment contracts are not expected to threaten the financial solvency of the risk-bearing provider organization; and  (7) such other information as the division may specify through regulation.  (d) There shall be a fee for such application or renewal, in an amount determined by the commissioner.  (e) A risk-bearing provider organization shall notify the commissioner of any material change to the information submitted in its initial or renewal application, in a form approved by the commissioner.
