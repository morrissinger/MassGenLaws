        Whenever the authority deems it necessary to make surveys, soundings, test pits, borings, drillings or examinations to obtain information for or to expedite the construction of public transportation facilities or other projects under its jurisdiction, said authority, or its authorized agents or employees may, after 30 days notice by registered or certified mail and without the necessity of any judicial orders or other legal proceedings, enter upon any lands, waters and premises, not including buildings, in the commonwealth, including lands both publicly and privately owned, including land owned by railroad corporations, for the purpose of making such surveys, soundings, test pits, borings, drillings or examinations as it may deem necessary or convenient for the purposes of this section, and the entry shall not be deemed to be a trespass. Said authority shall make reimbursement for any injury or damage to lands resulting from entry caused by any act of its authorized agents or employees and shall, so far as possible, restore such lands to the same condition as prior to the making of such surveys, soundings, test pits, borings, drillings or examinations.
