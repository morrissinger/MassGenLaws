        Every corporation may, at a meeting duly called for the purpose, by the vote of a majority of all its stock, or, if two or more classes of stock have been issued, of a majority of each class outstanding and entitled to vote, authorize an increase or a reduction of its capital stock and determine the terms and manner of the disposition of such increased stock, or authorize such terms and manner of disposition to be determined in whole or in part by the board of directors or officers of the corporation, may authorize a change of the location of its principal office or place of business in this commonwealth or a change of the par value of the shares of its capital stock, or may authorize proceedings for its dissolution under section fifty of chapter one hundred and fifty-five. Such increased stock may in whole or in part be disposed of without being offered to the stockholders. Any corporation having authorized shares with par value may, at a meeting duly called for the purpose, by the vote of a majority of all its stock, or, if two or more classes of stock have been issued, of a majority of each class outstanding and entitled to vote, including in any event a majority of the outstanding stock of each class affected, change such shares or any class thereof into any number of shares without par value, or provide for the exchange thereof pro rata for any number of shares without par value; provided, that the preferences, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications of the outstanding shares so changed or exchanged shall not be otherwise impaired or diminished without the consent of the holders thereof; and provided, further, that the total authorized capital stock of such corporation shall not be less than one thousand dollars, for this purpose counting shares without par value as of a par value of one hundred dollars each.
