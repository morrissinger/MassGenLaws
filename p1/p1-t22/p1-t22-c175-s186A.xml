        The delivery of any policy of life or endowment insurance or annuity contract shall create a presumption that any conditions precedent, other than a condition requiring prepayment of the initial premium, to the attaching of the policy or contract have been performed. In any court action based on a life insurance policy in which the good health of the insured at the time the policy becomes effective is at issue, there shall be a presumption that the insured was in good health if the insurer delivered the policy.
