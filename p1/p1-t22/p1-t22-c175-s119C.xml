In the event the insurer does not pay interest on proceeds left on deposit with the insurer, the rate of interest shall be six per cent. If the beneficiary brings an action to enforce such payments and prevails, the court shall award interest in accordance with the provisions of section six C of chapter two hundred and thirty-one, in lieu of any interest payment contained in this section.
