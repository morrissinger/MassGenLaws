        Whenever any bank of whose property and business the commissioner has taken possession deems itself aggrieved thereby, it may, at any time within ten days after such taking possession, apply to the supreme judicial court to enjoin further proceedings; said court, after citing the commissioner to show cause why further proceedings should not be enjoined, and after hearing the allegations and proofs of the parties and determining the facts, may, upon the merits, dismiss such application or may enjoin the commissioner from further proceedings and direct him to surrender the said business and property to the bank.
