Two or more railroad corporations whose railroads connect shall not charge or receive for the transportation of freight to any station on the railroad of either of them a greater amount than is at the time charged or received for the transportation of the like class and quantity of freight from the same original point of departure to a station at a greater distance on the railroad of either of them in the same direction. In construing this section, the amount charged or received for the transportation of freight shall include all terminal charges; and the railroad of a corporation shall include all the railroad in use by it, whether owned or operated under a contract or lease.
