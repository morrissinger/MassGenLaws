        No person shall drive any motor vehicle under authority of this chapter unless he shall, in addition to being duly licensed by the registrar of motor vehicles to operate such motor vehicles, be licensed by the department. No such license shall be issued by the department to any person who has not attained age eighteen or who has not qualified in accordance with the departmentâ€™s requirements or to any person who has attained age seventy unless such person, within ninety days of his seventieth birthday, and twice in each year thereafter at intervals not less than three nor more than six months apart, passes a physical examination in accordance with requirements established by the department. The department shall charge fees for the examination, issuance, and renewal of such license, the amount of which shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven for the filing thereof, and said department may revoke or suspend such a license at any time for such cause as may seem to it sufficient. No other license or permit than as specified or referred to in this section shall be required for any such driver.
