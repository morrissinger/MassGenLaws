The office shall provide notice to consumers of the establishment of a no sales solicitation calls listing. A consumer who wishes to be included on the listing shall notify the office by calling toll-free number provided by the office, or in such other manner and at such times as the office may prescribe, which may include electronic notification. A consumer on such listing shall be deleted from such listing upon the consumerâ€™s written request or in such other manner and at such times as the division may prescribe, which may include electronic notification. The office shall update such listing not less than quarterly and shall make such listing available to telephone solicitors and other persons for a fee as the office shall prescribe.
