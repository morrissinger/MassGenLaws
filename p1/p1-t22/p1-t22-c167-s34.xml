        Whenever the commissioner has paid to every depositor and creditor of such corporation, not including stockholders, whose claims as such creditors or depositors have been duly approved and allowed, the full amount of such claims, and has made proper provision for unclaimed and unpaid deposits or dividends, and has paid all expenses of the liquidation, he shall call a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation by mailing notice thereof, not less than thirty days prior to the date of the meeting, to each stockholder of record whose address is known, and also by publishing notice of the meeting once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published in the county wherein the principal office of the corporation is located, the first publication to be not less than thirty days before the date appointed for the meeting. At such meeting the stockholders shall determine whether the commissioner shall be continued as liquidator and shall wind up the affairs of the corporation, or whether an agent or agents shall be elected therefor, and in so determining, the stockholders shall vote by ballot, in person or by proxy, each share of stock entitling the holder to one vote; and a majority of the stock shall be necessary for the determination. (If it is determined to continue the liquidation and, after paying the expenses thereof, distribute the proceeds remaining among the stockholders in proportion to their several holdings of stock, in such manner and upon such notice as may be directed by the supreme judicial court.) If it is determined to appoint an agent or agents to liquidate, the stockholders shall thereupon select such agent or agents by ballot, a majority of the stock present and voting, in person or by proxy, being necessary to a choice. Such agent or agents shall execute and file with the commissioner a bond to the state treasurer in such amount, with such sureties and in such form as shall be approved by the commissioner, conditioned for the faithful performance of all the duties of his or their trust, and thereupon the commissioner shall transfer and deliver to such agent or agents all undivided, uncollected or other assets of the corporation then remaining in his hands. Upon such transfer and delivery, the commissioner shall be discharged from all further liability to such corporation. Said agent or agents shall convert into cash the assets coming into his or their possession and shall account for and make distribution of the property of the corporation as provided in the case of distribution by the commissioner, except that the expenses thereof shall be subject to the direction and control of the supreme judicial court. In case of the death, removal or refusal to act of any such agents, the stockholders, on the like notice to be given by the commissioner upon proof of such death, removal or refusal to act being filed with him, and by the like vote hereinbefore provided, may elect a successor who shall have the same powers and be subject to the same liabilities and duties as the agent originally elected.
