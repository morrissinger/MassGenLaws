Except as provided in a written operating agreement, a member may not be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from a limited liability company to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed to him exceeds a percentage of the asset which is equal to the percentage in which he shares in distributions from the limited liability company.
