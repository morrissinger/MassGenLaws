        The attorney general may, at the request of the commissioner, maintain and prosecute, in the name of the commonwealth, an action against any insurer, its officers, directors, trustees or agents or against any broker or adjuster or against any other person or persons subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of obtaining an injunction restraining such person or persons from doing any acts in violation of the provisions of this chapter. In such action, if the court finds that a defendant is threatening or is likely to do any act or acts in violation of this chapter, and that such violation will cause irreparable injury to the interests of the people of the commonwealth, the court may grant an injunction restraining such violation. The court may on motion and affidavits grant a preliminary injunction and interlocutory injunction, upon such terms as may be just; but the people of the commonwealth shall not be required to give security before the issuance of any such injunction.
