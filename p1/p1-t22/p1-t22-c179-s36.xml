        If it is for the interest of the proprietors of five or more parcels of land to enclose them in one common field, the superior court for the county where the land or any part of it lies may, upon the application of a majority in interest of the proprietors, after notice to all other persons interested and a hearing, order it to be so enclosed, if it appears to be for the common benefit of the parties.
