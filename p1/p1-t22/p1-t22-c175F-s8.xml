        A fund organized under this chapter shall, before it shall be certified pursuant to section three, satisfy the commissioner in its application that a claims reserve exists in accordance with this section. Such claims reserve shall be maintained at a level prescribed by an actuary or by a reasonable substitute for an actuary, which level shall exceed four hundred thousand dollars or some other reasonable minimum to be established by the commissioner by regulation. In establishing this minimum, the commissioner shall consider other legal obligations which might be required of the fund by other governmental units, in order to avoid unnecessary and duplicative or conflicting requirements.
