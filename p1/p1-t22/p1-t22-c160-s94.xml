If he is an owner of land adjoining such line, the corporation shall also have a lien upon said land for labor performed and furnished and all materials furnished and used by it in erecting and repairing such fences upon such land, and for the costs which may arise in enforcing it; and it shall be enforced in the manner provided for enforcing liens for labor in chapter two hundred and fifty-four.
