        The several boards, departments and commissions authorized by law to grant locations to companies may, to enable any such company to avoid interruption of its service, on petition of such company or of any interested party, grant temporary locations for the tracks of the company in any public place or way, or may approve temporary locations upon private land without notice and hearing. The body granting or approving such temporary locations may place a limit of time upon their use, and if unlimited as to time such use shall terminate after such reasonable time as, in the opinion of such body, will permit, without interruption, the restoration of service upon the locations of the company. The department may approve such temporary locations without notice and hearing.
