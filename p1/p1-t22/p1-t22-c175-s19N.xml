        If the name of a mutual insurer reorganizing to a stock insurer pursuant to sections 19F to 19W, inclusive, includes the word mutual, the new stock insurer may continue to use the word mutual in its name unless the commissioner finds that the continued use of the word mutual in its name is likely to mislead or deceive the public.
