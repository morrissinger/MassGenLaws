Any health maintenance organization which is subject to registration under this section shall register within 15 days after it becomes subject to registration, or 180 days after the effective date of this section, whichever is later, and annually thereafter for the previous calendar year, unless the commissioner for good cause shown extends the time for registration, and then within such extended time.
