        Any insurer authorized to issue annuity contracts in the commonwealth may issue one or more funding agreements, in fixed or variable amounts or in both, to fund (i) benefits under any employee benefit plan as defined in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. section 1002; (ii) the activities of any organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar organization in any foreign country; (iii) any program of the government of the United States, the government of any state, foreign country or political subdivision thereof; (iv) any agreement providing for periodic payments in satisfaction of a claim; or (v) any program of any individual or entity which has assets in excess of $25,000,000. Amounts paid to the insurer under such funding agreements may be allocated by the insurer to its general account or to one or more separate accounts pursuant to section 132F or section 132G. The issuance of a funding agreement in the commonwealth shall constitute doing an insurance business herein. For purposes of section 180F, funding agreements shall be treated as insurance contracts, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to the same priority of distribution as policyholders.
