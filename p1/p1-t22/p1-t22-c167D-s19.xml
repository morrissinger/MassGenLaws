    <text>
        Whenever a bank as a consequence of a default of a debt owed to said bank by a depositor or shareholder, makes a transfer of funds of such depositor or shareholder to reduce or extinguish said debt, such depositor or shareholder shall be notified forthwith of such transfer by written notice sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to his last known address; provided, however, that no such transfer shall be made if such debt is the result of consumer credit granted under the provisions of chapter one hundred and forty D unless the written notice required by section twenty-three of said chapter one hundred and forty D has been given. A depositor or shareholder to whom such notice has not been sent shall be entitled to recover the amount of any actual damages.
