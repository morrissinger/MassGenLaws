        Any such corporation may pay interest on regular savings accounts at such rate as its board of directors may determine and may pay variable rates of interest on other types of savings accounts; provided, however, that the rates so paid shall be consistent with the maximum rates from time to time established by the appropriate federal supervisory agencies. In the event that such federal supervisory agencies cease to establish such maximum rates, then any such corporation may pay interest on regular savings accounts at such rate as its board of directors may determine, and may, with the approval of the commissioner, pay variable rates of interest on other types of savings accounts. 
Interest may be paid on savings deposits from the date of deposit to the date of withdrawal and if its by-laws or regulations so provide such corporation may also pay interest on a savings deposit received during the first ten calendar days of any month calculated from the first day of such month until such deposit is withdrawn. 
Interest not withdrawn shall be treated as deposits and, in computing the dividend next following, shall be considered as having been on deposit for the preceding dividend period.
