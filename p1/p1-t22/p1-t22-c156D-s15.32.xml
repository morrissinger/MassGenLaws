    	     A foreign corporation the authority to transact business in the commonwealth of which has been revoked under section 15.30 may apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement of such authority at any time. The application shall:
        </section>
        <section prefix="1">
    	     recite the name of the foreign corporation and the effective date of the revocation;
        </section>
        <section prefix="2">
    	     state that the ground or grounds for revocation either did not exist or have been eliminated;
        </section>
        <section prefix="3">
    	     state that the foreign corporations name satisfies the requirements of sections 4.01 and 15.06; and
        </section>
        <section prefix="4">
    	     contain a certificate from the department of revenue reciting that all tax returns required to be filed by the foreign corporation under chapters 62C and 63 have been filed and all taxes shown due on such returns and any related penalties have been paid.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) and that the information is correct, he shall reinstate the authority of the foreign corporation to transact business in the commonwealth and shall note the fact of reinstatement on his records and the effective date of reinstatement.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     The secretary of state may subject such reinstatement to such terms and conditions, including the payment of reasonable fees, as in his judgment the public interest may require. He may in his discretion make the reinstatement effective for all purposes or for any specified purpose or purposes, in each case with or without limitation of time. When the reinstatement is effective, if by its terms it is effective for all purposes or if the secretary of state specifies that it shall be effective for purposes of this sentence, then the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the revocation of authority and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the revocation of authority had never occurred, with all its original powers and duties and with liability, for all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done or performed in its name and on its behalf before reinstatement, as if the revocation of authority had never occurred, except as otherwise specified by the secretary of state.
        </section>
        <section prefix="d">
    	     Any limitation in the reinstatement relative to the purpose or purposes of reinstatement, or of a limitation of the time thereof, may be amended by the secretary of state for cause shown to his satisfaction.
