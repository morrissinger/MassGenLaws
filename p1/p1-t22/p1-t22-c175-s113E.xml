        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an insurance company, its agent or any broker, from requiring a deposit premium before issuance of a policy or execution of a bond, providing the per vehicle deposit does not exceed thirty per cent of the annual premium or the full short term premium for the insurance requested, whichever is less, unless the applicant has been in default in the payment of any premium for automobile insurance during the preceding twenty-four months.
