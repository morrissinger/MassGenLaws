        Any natural gas pipe line company which lays pipes or other underground equipment or structures on any land on which it does not have a fee, shall, within sixty days after laying such pipe, equipment or structure, mark on the land, in such manner as not to interfere with the use of such land, the actual location of such pipe, equipment or structure and furnish the owner of the land, within thirty days after the owner makes a written request therefor, with an accurate plan, suitable for recording or registration, showing the exact location of the pipe line easement with reference to the bounds and boundaries of the land. This obligation shall be specifically enforceable in equity by the supreme judicial or superior court upon application of the owner of the land, and in such proceeding the owner may recover the damages occasioned by or resulting from the failure or delay of the company in complying with the provisions of this section.
