        A credit union shall maintain an allowance for loan losses or reserve for loan losses calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles or as otherwise directed by the commissioner. For the purposes of this chapter, any reference to the term “loan reserve” shall mean the allowance for loan losses or the reserve calculated under this section. 
Should the reserves maintained in this section and section seventy exceed the amount necessary to be kept or maintained in those accounts, the credit union may transfer such excess into an undivided earnings account.
