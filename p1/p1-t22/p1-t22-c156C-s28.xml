    	     Except as provided in a written operating agreement, a member is obligated to a limited liability company to perform any promise to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if he is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, he is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value as stated in the records of the limited liability company of the contribution that has not been made. The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the limited liability company may have against such member under an operating agreement or applicable law.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     Unless otherwise provided in a written operating agreement, the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this chapter may be compromised only by consent of all the members. Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit, after the entering into of the operating agreement or an amendment thereto which, in either case, reflects the obligation, and before the amendment thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     An operating agreement may provide that the interest of a member who fails to make any contribution or other payment that the member is required to make shall be subject to specified remedies for, or specified consequences of, the failure. The remedy or consequence may take the form of reducing the defaulting member’s interest in the limited liability company, subordinating the defaulting member’s interest in the limited liability company to that of the nondefaulting members, a forced sale of the interest in the limited liability company, forfeiture of the interest in the limited liability company, the lending by the nondefaulting members of the amount necessary to meet the commitment, a fixing of the value of the member’s interest in the limited liability company by appraisal or by formula and redemption and sale of the member’s interest in the limited liability company at that value, or other remedy or consequences.
