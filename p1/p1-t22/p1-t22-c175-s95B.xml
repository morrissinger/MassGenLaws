        No company, and no officer or agent thereof, and no insurance broker, shall cancel, refuse to issue or renew, or in any way make or permit any distinction or discrimination in the amount or payment of premiums or rates charged, in the length of coverage, or in any other of the terms and conditions of a residential property insurance policy upon property within the commonwealth based upon information that an applicant or policy owner, or any member of their family, has been a victim of abuse as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and nine A. No company, and no officer or agent thereof, and no insurance broker shall seek information that such person has been a victim of abuse as defined by said section one of said chapter two hundred and nine A.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a special class of insureds who have been victims of abuse as defined by said section one of said chapter two hundred and nine A. Any violation of this section shall constitute an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of chapters ninety-three A and one hundred and seventy-six D.
