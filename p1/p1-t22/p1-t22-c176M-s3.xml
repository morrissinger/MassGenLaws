    	     In calendar year nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, the carrier shall enroll eligible individuals into guaranteed issue health plans during an open enrollment period commencing June first and ending July thirty-first with coverage to become effective September first. The commissioner may postpone said open enrollment period and effective date of coverage should a substantial number of carriers, due to substantial administrative delay, be unable to enroll eligible individuals into a guaranteed issue health plan during the open enrollment period commencing June first and ending July thirty-first; provided, however, that any carrier that is unable to enroll eligible individuals into a guaranteed issue health plan during the open enrollment period beginning June first and ending July thirty-first, for reasons other than substantial administrative delay, may be subject to a fine of one thousand dollars for every day in which it is unable to enroll such eligible individuals in said guaranteed issue health plan and any other penalties available under this chapter.

If a policy includes a waiting period, emergency services shall be covered to the same extent that emergency services are covered during a waiting period under chapter 176J. In determining whether a pre-existing condition exclusion or a waiting period applies, all health benefit plans shall credit the time such person was covered under prior creditable coverage provided by a carrier if the previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than 63 days prior to the date of the request for the new coverage and if the previous coverage was reasonably actuarially equivalent to the new coverage. Coverage shall become effective within 30 days of the date of application.

    	     A carrier shall not be required to issue or renew a guaranteed issue health plan to any eligible individual if the carrier can demonstrate any of the following (1) that the acceptance of applications would create for the carrier a condition of financial impairment, and the carrier demonstrates the same to the commissioner; (2) that the eligible individual does not meet a health maintenance organization’s requirements regarding residence or employment within the health maintenance organization’s approved service area; or (3) that within an area, where the health maintenance organization reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that it will not, within that area, have the capacity in its network of providers to deliver services adequately to the individual because of its obligation to existing contract holders and enrollees; provided, however, that such a health maintenance organization shall not offer coverage in the applicable area to any new applicants for coverage, whether they be applicants for group or nongroup coverage, until the later of ninety days after each such refusal or the date on which the health maintenance organization notifies the commissioner that it has regained capacity to deliver services to eligible individuals.

    	     A carrier that decides to terminate coverage for all eligible individuals enrolled in a specific guaranteed issue plan shall notify the commissioner of insurance no later than 180 days prior to terminating coverage under that guaranteed issue health benefit plan. A carrier may not terminate a guaranteed issue health plan if such termination would cause the carrier to violate subsection (b) of section two. A carrier who terminates guaranteed issue health plans pursuant to this subsection shall not issue any guaranteed issue health benefit plans pursuant to this subsection for a period of five years; provided, however, that the commissioner, in his discretion, may allow a carrier to re-enter the nongroup market sooner.
