Each electric company which intends to be a party to any purchase and sale referred to in this section exceeding fifty thousand dollars in value, but not greater than two hundred thousand dollars in value, shall notify the department in writing of its intention to enter into such purchase and sale at least forty-five days prior to the intended date of consummation thereof, and the department may by order and notice issued at least fifteen days prior to such intended consummation, sent to each party to such intended purchase and sale, suspend such purchase and sale and after notice and a public hearing determine whether to approve such purchase and sale and the terms thereof as consistent with the public interest. 
Any foreign corporation or association may consolidate with or merge into an electric company or may merge or consolidate its capital stock and property with an electric company provided that the entity resulting from such consolidation or merger shall be an electric company; and provided, further, that no such merger or consolidation shall be binding until the same and the terms thereof shall have been approved (a) by such electric company, at a meeting called therefor, by vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, and (b) by the foreign corporation or association in accordance with its charter and the laws of the state under which it is organized, so far as applicable, and until the department upon application of such electric company, after notice and a public hearing, shall have approved the same and the terms thereof as consistent with public interest; provided, further, that the electric company resulting from such merger or consolidation shall not exercise in this commonwealth any powers, rights, locations, licenses or privileges or any franchise so acquired which cannot be lawfully exercised by electric companies under this chapter.
