        Any bank or federally chartered bank may establish an account or accounts to receive deposits from a manager or managing agent acting as a trustee for funds received and held by such trustee pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of section ten of chapter one hundred and eighty-three A. Such account or accounts may be established as required by said section ten for the purpose of holding condominium funds taken by a manager or managing agent, but the terms of said account or accounts shall be such as to place said deposit beyond the claim of a creditor of the manager or managing agent, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy, and as will provide for the transfer of said deposit to the organization of unit owners or subsequent manager or managing agent, as determined by the organization of unit owners. Interest accruing on said deposit shall be paid to the organization of unit owners pursuant to the terms of the deposit. Withdrawals and payments made by the bank or federally chartered bank from said account or accounts shall discharge the liability of said bank or federally chartered bank to all persons.
