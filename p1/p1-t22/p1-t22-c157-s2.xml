        Such corporation shall distribute its earnings or profits among its workmen, purchasers and stockholders at such times and in such manner as its by-laws prescribe, but at least once in every twelve months. No distribution shall be made, unless at least ten per cent of the net profits have been appropriated for a contingent or sinking fund, until an amount has accumulated equal to thirty per cent of its capital stock issued and outstanding. No person shall hold shares in any such corporation to an amount exceeding one thousand dollars at their par value, nor shall a stockholder be entitled to more than one vote upon any subject.
