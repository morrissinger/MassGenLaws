        A party aggrieved by said award may, within fourteen days after the return thereof, apply to the court for a jury to revise and determine any matter of fact found therein; and thereupon the court, after notice to all parties interested, shall order a trial by jury in the same manner as civil cases are tried by jury. The decree of the court upon said award or upon the verdict of a jury, or upon agreement of the parties filed in said court, shall be final and binding, and said court may in equity enforce compliance therewith, and also issue and enforce such interlocutory decrees and orders as justice may require.
