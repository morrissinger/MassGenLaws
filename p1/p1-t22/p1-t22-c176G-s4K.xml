        A health maintenance contract shall provide coverage for a newborn hearing screening test to be performed before the newborn infant is discharged from the hospital or birthing center to the care of the parent or guardian, pursuant to regulations of the department of public health. Payment to physician, hospital or other provider for the costs of said test may be pursuant to the terms of a negotiated contract. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to abrogate any other obligation to provide coverage for a hearing screening test or any other hearing screening test or audiological diagnostic procedure pursuant to any law of the commonwealth or of the United States or under the terms or provisions of any contract or certificate.
