        If the department deems additional accommodations including waiting rooms, stations, water closets and other sanitary conveniences for the traveling public are required upon any street railway, it may, after due notice to the company and a hearing, make an order for such additional accommodations, and may alter, renew or revoke the order. A company which, for more than one week after receiving written notice of such order, fails to comply therewith, shall forfeit to the use of the city or town where such additional accommodations are to be used, or if they are to be used in more than one city or town, to the use equally of such cities or towns, one hundred dollars for each day thereafter during which such failure continues.
