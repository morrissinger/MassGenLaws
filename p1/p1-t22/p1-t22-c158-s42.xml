        A corporation which omits to file any certificate or copy which is required by section thirty-seven, thirty-nine or forty shall forfeit two hundred dollars, to be recovered in an action of tort brought in the name of the commonwealth in Suffolk county or in the county where the corporation is established; and its president, treasurer and directors, for the time being, shall in addition be jointly liable in a like amount for such omission; and all forfeitures by a corporation under any provision of this chapter may also be collected by information in equity, which may be brought in Suffolk county and shall be brought in the supreme judicial court in the name of the attorney general, at the relation of the secretary; and upon such information the court may issue an injunction restraining the further prosecution of the business of the corporation named therein until such forfeitures, with interest and costs, are paid and until the returns required by this chapter are filed.
