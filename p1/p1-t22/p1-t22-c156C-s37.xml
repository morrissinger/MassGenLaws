        A manager may resign as a manager of a limited liability company at the time or upon the happening of events specified in the operating agreement and in accordance with the operating agreement. An operating agreement may provide that a manager shall not have the right to resign as a manager of a limited liability company. Regardless of whether the operating agreement provides that a manager does not have the right to resign as a manager of a limited liability company, a manager may resign as a manager of a limited liability company at any time upon prior written notice to each member and each other manager at each member’s and each other manager’s address as set forth on the records of the limited liability company as of the date of the notice. If the resignation of a manager violates the operating agreement, in addition to any remedies otherwise available under applicable law, a limited liability company may recover from the resigning manager damages for breach of the operating agreement and offset the damages against any amounts otherwise distributable to the resigning manager.
