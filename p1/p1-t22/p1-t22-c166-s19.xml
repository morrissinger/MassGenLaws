        A telegraph company shall be liable for damages to the amount of one hundred dollars actually caused by its negligence, or that of its agents, in transmitting, receiving or delivering telegraphic messages, and any limit of such liability by contract or regulation shall apply only to the damages in each case in excess of one hundred dollars; but no action therefor shall be maintained unless a written claim is presented to such company or its agent within sixty days after such right of action accrues. This section shall not apply to negligence occurring in a telegraph office established for the convenience and safety of a railroad corporation in the running of its trains, and transacting a public telegraph business only as incidental thereto, nor to negligence in the delivery of messages received at such office.
