        Whenever any change is made in the officers of a corporation, except at the annual meeting, the corporation shall forthwith submit to the secretary a certificate of such change, signed and sworn to by the clerk. The secretary shall examine such certificate and if he finds that it conforms to the requirements of this chapter, he shall endorse his approval thereon and cause the same to be filed and preserved in book form convenient for and open to public inspection. Any corporation which fails to submit a certificate as aforesaid within thirty days after such change has been made, or which fails to keep a clerk of the corporation in this commonwealth, shall forfeit not more than five hundred dollars, to be recovered in the manner prescribed by section fifty-two.
