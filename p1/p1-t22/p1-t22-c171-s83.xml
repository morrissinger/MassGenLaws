Such association shall be formed when its by-laws have been approved and agreed to by a majority of the directors of each of fifteen or more credit unions and have been approved by the commissioner. Such association shall, annually, on or before December first, report to the commissioner such statements of its membership and financial transactions for the year ending on the preceding October thirty-first as the commissioner may consider necessary to show its business and standing. The commissioner may verify such statement by an examination of the books and papers of the association.
