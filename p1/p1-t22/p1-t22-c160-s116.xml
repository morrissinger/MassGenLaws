        A railroad corporation, upon the application of any shipper tendering freight for transportation, shall construct, maintain and operate upon reasonable terms switch connections with a lateral line of railroad or private side track owned, operated or controlled by such shipper and shall, upon the application of any shipper, provide upon its own property a side track and switch connection with its line of railroad, whenever such side track and switch connection are reasonably practicable, can be put in with safety, and the business therefor is sufficient to justify the same.
