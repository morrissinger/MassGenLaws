        If no corporate property can be found to satisfy a judgment recovered against the shareholders after the dissolution, and it is not satisfied within six months after it is recovered, the judgment creditor may satisfy the same out of the private estate of the shareholders or any of them, as if the judgment had been against them in their private capacity.
