        If the part of the fence apportioned to a proprietor becomes deficient and he does not repair it within three days after notice of such deficiency has been given to him by a fence viewer of the town, it may be repaired by any other proprietor. Two or more fence viewers may examine such repairs, and, if they adjudge them sufficient, may ascertain and determine the cost of the same and make a signed statement thereof and of the amount of their fees.
