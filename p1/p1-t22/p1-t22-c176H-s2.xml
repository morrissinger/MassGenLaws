        Any sponsor may establish and operate an insured legal services plan underwritten in whole or in part by an insurer subject to the provisions of this chapter. An insured legal services plan may be either an indemnity plan or a service plan, or a combination of both. Under an indemnity plan, benefits for covered legal services shall be paid to the insured for the legal services of an attorney of the insured’s choice. Under a service plan, benefits for covered legal services shall be paid to a participating attorney for the legal services of a participating attorney of the insured’s choice, provided, however, that such benefits shall be paid to an attorney for his legal services, whether or not such attorney is a participating attorney, if the insured chooses such attorney and notifies the insurer in writing before such legal services are rendered.
