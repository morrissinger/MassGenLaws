        <section prefix="a">
    	     Subject to the intent of a donor expressed in the gift instrument, an institution may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes and duration for which the endowment fund is established. Unless stated otherwise in the gift instrument, the assets in an endowment fund shall be donor-restricted assets until appropriated for expenditure by the institution. In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, the following factors:
        </section>
        <section prefix="i">
    	     the duration and preservation of the endowment fund;
        </section>
        <section prefix="ii">
    	     the purposes of the institution and the endowment fund;
        </section>
        <section prefix="iii">
    	     general economic conditions;
        </section>
        <section prefix="iv">
    	     the possible effect of inflation or deflation;
        </section>
        <section prefix="v">
    	     the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments;
        </section>
        <section prefix="vi">
    	     other resources of the institution; and
        </section>
        <section prefix="vii">
    	     the investment policy of the institution.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     To limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (a), a gift instrument shall specifically state the limitation.
        </section>
        <section prefix="c">
    	     Terms in a gift instrument designating a gift as an endowment, or a direction or authorization in the gift instrument to use only “income”, “interest”, “dividends” or “rents, issues or profits”, or “to preserve the principal intact” or words of similar import shall:
        </section>
        <section prefix="i">
    	     create an endowment fund of permanent duration unless other language in the gift instrument limits the duration of the fund; and
        </section>
        <section prefix="ii">
    	     not, standing alone, limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (a).
