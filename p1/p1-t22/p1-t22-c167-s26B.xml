    <catch_line>National Credit Union Administration Board As Liquidating Agent Of Credit Unions; Subrogation Rights</catch_line>
    <order_by>26B</order_by>
    <text>
        The commissioner may, under his hand and official seal, appoint the National Credit Union Administration Board as the liquidating agent of a credit union insured by said National Credit Union Administration Board. Upon its acceptance of the appointment, said board as liquidating agent shall acquire both legal and equitable title to all of the assets, rights or claims and to all of the real or personal property of such closed credit union. Said board shall have the power to perform all acts and duties of the commissioner in the liquidation of such closed credit union. Further, said board may also as liquidating agent aid in the liquidation of a credit union insured by it in the same manner and to the same extent as the Massachusetts Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation may aid in the liquidation of a credit union insured by that corporation, as provided in chapter 171. 
Whenever the National Credit Union Administration Board pays or makes payment of the insured share and deposit liabilities of a closed credit union, it shall become subrogated to all of the rights of the member and owner of the shares and deposits against the closed credit union, whether or not it becomes receiver thereof in the same manner and to the same extent as it would be subrogated in the closing of a federal credit union as provided in 12 U.S.C. section 1781.
