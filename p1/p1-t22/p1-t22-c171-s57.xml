        The capital, deposits and surplus of a credit union shall be invested in loans to members, with approval of the credit committee, as provided in section seventeen and, when so required herein, of the board of directors. 
All applications for loans shall be made in writing and shall state the purpose for which the loan is desired and the security, if any, offered. 
Personal loans shall always be given the preference and, in the event there are not sufficient funds available to satisfy all loan applications approved by the credit committee, preference shall be given to the smaller loan. 
Whenever the liquidity reserve required by section seventy-one falls below five percent of the total assets of a credit union, no further loans shall be made until the ratio as herein provided has been reestablished.
