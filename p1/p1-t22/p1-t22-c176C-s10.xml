The commissioner of insurance shall require every such corporation to keep its books, records, accounts and vouchers in such manner that he or his authorized representatives may readily verify its annual statements and ascertain whether the corporation has complied with the law. The commissioner of insurance is authorized and directed on request of the commissioner of public health to advise him on any financial, accounting, bookkeeping or other similar question arising out of the operation of any medical service plan.
