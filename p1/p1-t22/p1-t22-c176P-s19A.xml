        A society operating on the lodge system which provides for stated periodic contributions of its members based upon a table of mortality not lower than the National Fraternal Congress Table of Mortality, as adopted by the National Fraternal Congress on August 23, 1899, and 4 per cent interest, may provide that the amount of the death benefit payable by it shall be payable as an annuity. The annuity payments under this section shall be based upon a table not lower than “McClintock’s Table of Mortality among Annuitants”, or on such higher table as the commissioner may from time to time prescribe, with interest at not more than 4 per cent per annum. In no case shall the amount payable to the beneficiary or to the beneficiary’s estate be less than the amount of the death benefit specified in the certificate issued to the member.
