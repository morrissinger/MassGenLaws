        Whenever a grade crossing is abolished upon a state highway, county way, or way which has been petitioned for as a state highway, the said highway or way shall be so constructed that there shall be a clear view in each direction for at least one hundred and fifty feet from the center of said highway or other way where the same passes over or under the railroad, except in any particular case, when compliance with said requirement is deemed by the department of highways to be unnecessary and unreasonable under all the circumstances.
