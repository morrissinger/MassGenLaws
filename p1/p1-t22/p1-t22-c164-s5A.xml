        The name of a corporation subject to this chapter shall contain the words “gas company” or “electric company”, as the case may be. Such corporation shall not assume the name or trade name of another corporation established under the laws of the commonwealth, or of a corporation wherever established, firm, association or person carrying on business in the commonwealth, at the time of incorporation or change of name of the corporation assuming any such name or within three years prior thereto, or assume a name which is under reservation under the laws of the commonwealth for another or proposed corporation wherever established, or assume a name so similar to the foregoing as to be likely to be mistaken for it, except with the written consent of the said corporation, firm or association or of such person previously filed with the state secretary. The supreme judicial or superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon the application of any person interested or affected, to enjoin such corporation from doing business under a name assumed in violation of any provision of this section, although articles of organization or articles of amendment may have been approved and filed. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section eleven of chapter one hundred and fifty-six B shall apply to corporations subject to this chapter.
