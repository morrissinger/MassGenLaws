        Such suit shall not be discontinued by the plaintiff except by order of the court after notice to other creditors. It shall not abate by reason of the non-joinder of persons liable as defendants, unless the plaintiff, after notice by plea or answer of their existence, unreasonably neglects to make them parties; nor shall it abate by reason of the death of a defendant, but his estate shall be liable in the hands of his executor or administrator, who may voluntarily appear, or who may be summoned by the plaintiff, to defend the suit.
