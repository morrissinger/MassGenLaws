        The authority of a society licensed under the provisions of this chapter may be renewed annually, but in all cases shall terminate on the first day of the succeeding July; provided, however, a license so issued shall continue in full force and effect until the new license be issued or specifically refused. For each such license or renewal the society shall pay the commissioner a fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. A duly certified copy or duplicate of such license shall be prima facie evidence that the licensee is a fraternal benefit society within the meaning of this chapter.
