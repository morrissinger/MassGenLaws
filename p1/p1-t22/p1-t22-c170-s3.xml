        A corporation formed pursuant to section two may authorize, at a meeting duly called for the purpose, by vote of two-thirds of the shareholders present and voting a change of its corporate name. Within sixty days after any meeting at which such change has been authorized, articles of amendment, signed under the penalties of perjury by the executive officer and by the clerk, setting forth such change and the due adoption thereof, shall be submitted to the state secretary and the commissioner. If such amendment is approved by the commissioner, it shall take effect upon the filing of such approval with the state secretary.
