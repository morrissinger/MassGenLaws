    	     The compacting states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the interstate insurance product regulation commission. Pursuant to section 3, the commission shall have the power to develop uniform standards for product lines, receive and provide prompt review of products filed therewith, and give approval to those product filings satisfying applicable uniform standards; but, it is not intended for the commission to be the exclusive entity for receipt and review of insurance product filings. Nothing herein shall prohibit an insurer from filing its product in a state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance; and the filing shall be subject to the laws of the state where filed.
