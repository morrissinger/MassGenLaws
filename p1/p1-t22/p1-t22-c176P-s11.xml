        A limited society may, with the approval of the commissioner, change the location of its place of business to another location in the commonwealth, or change the purposes for which it was incorporated so as to permit it to transact any business authorized by this chapter. Upon such approval, the presiding financial and recording officers, and a majority of its other officers having the powers of directors, shall file with the state secretary a certificate, with the approval of the commissioner endorsed thereon, setting forth the change in the location of its place of business or in the purposes of the corporation. The state secretary shall, upon receipt of $5, cause such certificate to be filed in his office. Every domestic society may exercise all the rights, powers and privileges conferred by this chapter, including the powers specified in section 32, or its certificate of incorporation or charter, not inconsistent herewith, and shall be subject to this chapter, as if reincorporated hereunder.
