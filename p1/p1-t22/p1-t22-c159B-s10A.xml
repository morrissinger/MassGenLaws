        When a distinguishing plate issued by the department is lost or mutilated or the number thereon becomes illegible, the carrier to whom such plate was issued shall make application for a plate replacement. The department may issue additional plates to replace such plates issued under section nine or ten as have been lost or mutilated or as are illegible, upon payment of a fee for each such additional plate. The amount of any fees referred to herein shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. The department may issue a duplicate certificate, permit or license in place of one issued under this chapter which has been lost or destroyed as well as certified copies of certificates, permits, licenses, or plate certificates upon payment of a fee as determined pursuant to the aforementioned chapter seven. 
If a vehicle identification device other than a distinguishing plate is lost, destroyed, mutilated or becomes illegible a new device may be issued therefor upon application by the motor carrier and upon payment of the same fee prescribed for the original issuance thereof.
