        The commissioner, or any deputy examiner or any other person designated by the commissioner, shall, at least once in three years, and whenever the commissioner deems it prudent, visit any optometric service corporation and examine into its affairs. The commissioner shall have free access to all of the books, records and papers of the corporation, and may summon and examine under oath its officers, agents, employees and other persons in relation to its affairs and condition. The commissioner shall require every such corporation to keep its books, records, accounts and vouchers in such manner that he or his authorized representatives may readily verify its annual statements and determine whether the corporation has complied with the law.
