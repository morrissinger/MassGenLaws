        The reserves of a dental service corporation shall be invested only in such securities as are permitted under chapter 175 for the investment of the reserves of insurance companies. A dental service corporation shall have the right to acquire and own real estate to be occupied by itself in the transaction of its business. The commissioner may require any such corporation after its first full calendar year of doing business to accumulate and maintain a special contingent surplus, over and above its reserves and liabilities, in such amount as the commissioner may deem proper. All other funds of a dental service corporation shall be invested only as is permitted by chapter 180A for the investment of institutional funds.
