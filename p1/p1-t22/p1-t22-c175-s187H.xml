        No policy of individual life insurance with a face amount of less than twenty-five thousand dollars shall be delivered or issued for delivery in the commonwealth unless it shall have printed thereon or attached thereto a notice stating in substance that the owner of the policy shall be permitted to cancel said policy within ten days of its delivery by the insurer if, after examination of the policy, the owner is not satisfied with it for any reason. If the owner, pursuant to such notice, surrenders the policy to the insurer by delivering it to the home office or branch office of said insurer, or to the agent through whom it was purchased, any premium paid shall be refunded and the policy shall upon such delivery be deemed void from the beginning.
