The total liabilities to any credit union of an organization member and the total liabilities of more than one such member, the majority interest of which is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same person or persons, fraternal organizations, voluntary associations, partnerships or corporations, for money borrowed pursuant to the provisions of section sixty-five, including in the liabilities of a partnership or company not incorporated the liabilities of the several members thereof, shall not at any one time exceed the total liability of a shareholder or depositor as authorized by said section sixty-five. 
In computing the total liability of a member hereunder, there shall be included the direct liability of the member and his liability as endorser, guarantor or surety on the obligation of others which are held by the credit union; provided, however, there shall be excluded from such computation the amount of any mortgage loan secured by a first lien on real estate improved with a dwelling to be occupied by not more than four families and occupied or to be occupied, in whole or in part, by such member. 
The members at each annual meeting shall fix the maximum amount to be loaned to any one member.
