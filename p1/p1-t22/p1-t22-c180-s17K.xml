    <text>
        Deductions on payroll schedules may be made from the salary of a state employee for the payment of the cost of near-site parking fees for state employees whose work location lacks adequate public transportation, for on-site state employer-provided child care fees and for other state employer-provided benefits. Any categories of payroll deductions established under this section for such other state employer-provided benefits shall be approved by the comptroller as appropriate payroll deductions. The state treasurer, the common paymaster as defined in section 133 of chapter 175, shall deduct from the salary of state employees the full amount for such near-site parking fees, on-site child care fees and fees for any such other state employer-provided benefits as are established pursuant to this section.
