        Unless the articles of organization or the by-laws otherwise provide, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the directors may be taken without a meeting if all the directors consent to the action in writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of directors. Such consents shall be treated for all purposes as a vote at a meeting. 
Unless the articles of organization or the by-laws otherwise provide, members of the board of directors of any corporation or any committee designated thereby may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.
