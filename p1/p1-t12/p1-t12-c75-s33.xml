        In addition to the commonwealth scholarships authorized under section thirty-one, the University of Massachusetts may also grant quarter, half and full scholarships to be known as university scholarships to worthy and qualified students who have been residents of the commonwealth for the four years prior to enrollment at the university and are in need of financial assistance. In the awarding of said scholarships first preference shall be given to students who have enrolled in agricultural or food technological courses. Said scholarships shall be recommended by the committee on scholarships established under said section thirty-one, and shall be approved and awarded by the board of trustees of the university. Said trustees may use for the purposes of this section, such sums, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars, as may be appropriated from the Agricultural Purposes Fund, and may use the same for matching federal grants made under the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and when so used awards made shall be subject to the provisions of said act. A scholarship shall continue for such times as the recipient thereof remains a student in good standing at the university, but in no event for more than four years.
