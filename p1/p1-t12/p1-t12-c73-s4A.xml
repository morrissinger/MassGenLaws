        A teacher in a state university who has served as such in the state universities for at least seven years after entering such service or, if a leave of absence has previously been granted to him hereunder, after the termination of the last such leave may, upon written recommendation of the president of the university wherein he is employed, be granted by the director of the division of state universities, a leave of absence, for study and research, for a period of one year at half pay or for a period of a half year at full pay for such period; provided, that prior to the granting of such leave said teacher shall enter into a written agreement with the board of trustees that upon the termination of such leave he will return to the state university service and serve as a teacher in the same or another state university for a period equal to twice the length of such leave and that, in default of completing such service, he will refund to the commonwealth, unless excused therefrom by the department for reasons satisfactory to it, an amount equal to such proportion of the salary received by him while on leave as the amount of service not actually rendered as agreed bears to the whole amount of service agreed to be rendered. For the purposes of this section, service in The Teachers College of the City of Boston shall be deemed to have been service in a state university.
