The report shall detail enrollment levels, revenues received, sources of revenues, recruitment tools, the number of service contracts established with commonwealth employers and such other information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner shall prepare a comprehensive report of the information and present copies of the report to the board of higher education and the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on labor and workforce development not later than March 31 annually.
