        Cities and towns may accept grants or gifts for purposes of library construction or renovations, including the planning therefor from private persons or corporations and from charitable foundations and may disburse the same for such purposes. Cities and towns may include any such funds in the determination of the local match in applying for assistance from the commonwealth for a grant for an approved public library project. Any amounts so received by a city or town shall be deposited with the treasurer of such city or town and held as a separate account and may be expended without further appropriation, notwithstanding the provisions of section fifty-three of chapter forty-four.
