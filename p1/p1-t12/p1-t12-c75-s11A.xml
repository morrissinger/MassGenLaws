        The board of trustees shall not allow any funds for legislative agents as defined in section thirty-nine of chapter three or organizations attempting to influence legislation as defined in section forty-four of said chapter three to be assessed on student tuition bills; provided, however, that optional fees for nonpartisan student organizations which employ said legislative agents or attempt to influence legislation shall be collected by the boards of trustees whenever students have authorized an optional fee by a majority vote of those students voting in an official student referendum. Said optional fees shall be collected as provided in paragraph (b) of section eighteen of chapter fifteen A. 
No funds collected as a mandatory student activities fee shall be paid to legislative agents as defined in section thirty-nine of said chapter three or organizations attempting to influence legislation as defined in section forty-four of said chapter three. As used in this section, the term “legislative agent” or “organization attempting to influence legislation” shall not include any official representative of the student body.
