        The board shall make such rules and regulations not inconsistent with law as are necessary and proper for the conduct of the process of certification, including issuance, renewal or revocation of certificates, and to provide for hearings in the case of applicants whose requests for certificates have been refused or whose certificates have been suspended or revoked, in cases where application for such hearing has been made to the board. 
No regulation shall be accepted for filing with the state secretary unless such regulation has been submitted to the clerks of the senate and house of representatives who shall refer such regulations to the appropriate joint committee for its review and comment ninety days prior to the effective date of said regulations. Said committee may submit written comments and suggested changes, if any, to the board at least sixty days prior to said effective date. The board in filing its regulations shall consider the comments and suggested changes and submit revised regulations, or a detailed explanation of why the suggested changes will not be adopted, to such committee at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the regulations.
