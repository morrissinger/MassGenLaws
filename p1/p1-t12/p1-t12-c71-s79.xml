    <order_by>79</order_by>
    <text>
        Any city or town may use the designation “Junior College” with respect to its maintenance of such extended course of instruction at a particular school therein, and the school committee of such city or town may, subject to the approval of the board of higher education, grant any one or more of the degrees of associate in arts, associate in engineering or associate in science to persons who complete such course of instruction. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a school established hereunder may be designated by a name which does not include the word “junior”; provided, however, that the charter of such school shall require that such name, when used on its official documents and publications, be accompanied by a descriptive phrase which, in the judgment of the board of regents, will effectively distinguish such school from a senior college.
