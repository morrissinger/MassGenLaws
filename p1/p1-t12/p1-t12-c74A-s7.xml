The board of trustees shall submit to the commissioner of education not later than December 31 of each year a proposed budget for the following fiscal year. The commissioner shall either approve the budget as requested or, if he determines that the amount requested is excessive or unreasonable, shall approve a lesser amount. The commissioner shall calculate a tuition assessment for such fiscal year, equal to the amount of the approved budget less the amounts estimated to be received from state aid and other sources. The amount of state education aid for independent agricultural and technical schools shall be calculated pursuant to chapter 70 and shall be supplemented with a state appropriation pursuant to section 17 of chapter 34B. Not more than 30 days after the effective date of any law that alters the provisions of said chapter 70, the commissioner shall report the impact of any formula changes to the house and senate committee on ways and means. Said tuition assessment shall be paid by the various cities and towns in accordance with section 8.
