        For approved projects that are an alternative to construction or renovation, the authority shall establish eligible cost criteria, and on a case by case basis, shall determine the allowable cost of the project. Eligible costs may include but shall not be limited to furnishings and equipment, lease costs, rental fees, tuition costs and transportation costs. In no event shall an alternative project be reimbursed if it is determined by the authority to be more costly than construction necessary to achieve the same end.
