        Upon the acceptance of this section by the local legislative body of a city or town, or by a majority vote of two-thirds of the member communities of a regional school district, the school committee of a city, town or regional school district shall establish a pupil absence notification program in all schools under its control. Said program may be developed with the assistance of the department of education. The parents or guardians of each pupil shall, annually, at the commencement of each school year, be sent a notice instructing them to call a designated telephone number at a designated time to inform the school of the absence of a pupil and the reason therefor. Said notice shall also require such parent or guardian to furnish the school with a home, work or other emergency telephone number where they can be contacted during the school day. If a pupil is absent and the school has not been notified by the designated time, the school shall call the telephone number or numbers furnished to inquire about said absence.
