        A parent or guardian of twins or higher order multiples may, if the children are in the same grade level at the same school request that the children be placed in the same classroom or in separate classrooms. The school may recommend classroom placement to the parents and provide professional education advice to the parents to assist in making the best decision for their children’s education; provided, however, that the school shall provide the placement requested by the children’s parent or guardian. The parent or guardian must request the classroom placement not later than 14 days after the first day of each school year or 14 days after the first day of attendance of the children during a school year. 
For purposes of this section, “higher order multiples”, shall mean triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, or more.
