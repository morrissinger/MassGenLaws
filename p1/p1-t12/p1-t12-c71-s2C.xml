        Each school district in the commonwealth, subject to appropriation, shall implement a specific policy and discipline code to address teen dating violence in public schools. The policy shall clearly state that dating violence will not be tolerated and shall include guidelines for addressing alleged incidents of dating violence. The policy may include a teen dating violence prevention task force comprised of staff, students and parents to provide awareness training and education for the school community. Topics to be covered in the policy include, without limitation, defining the issue of teen dating violence, recognizing warning signs, identifying issues of confidentiality, safety and appropriate legal school-based interventions.
