        A regional school district may, by amendment to its regional school district agreement, provide for one of the following options concerning the members of its regional district school committee: (1) electing committee members by voters in member communities with each communityâ€™s representation apportioned according to population; (2) electing members in district-wide elections to be held at the biennial state elections; (3) electing members with residency requirements in district-wide elections to be held at the biennial state elections; (4) weighing the votes of committee members according to the population they represent; and (5) appointing committee members by locally elected officials such as school board members. Each regional school district shall designate an individual to serve as district clerk. 
If a regional school district decides to elect members in district-wide elections to be held at the biennial state elections or if any vacancy is to be so filled, the district clerk shall notify the state secretary by April fifteenth of the year of the biennial state election of that fact and also of his name and mailing address.
