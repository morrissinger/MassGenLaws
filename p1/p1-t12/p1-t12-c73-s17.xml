        The trustees shall have complete authority in determining the travel policy of a state university; provided, however, that said policy shall require coordination with the state purchasing agent to insure cost-effective utilization of the group purchasing power of the commonwealth. They shall determine which of the personnel of such university may travel within and without the commonwealth at state expense and where such personnel may travel.
