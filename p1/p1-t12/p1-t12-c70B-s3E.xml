        In addition to other remedies of the authority under any bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, if at any time any amount is distributable or payable by the commonwealth to any city, town or regional school district, and a sum is due to the authority from that city, town or regional school district, for any cause whatsoever, the sum due to the authority, as certified by the authority to the state treasurer, shall be deducted by the state treasurer from the amount distributable or payable to the city, town or regional school district and shall be paid promptly to the authority. Payment by the state treasurer under this section shall continue to be made until the deficiency on the part of the city, town or regional school district has been offset by the payments from the state treasurer. The authority may also recover from that city, town or regional school district, in an action in superior court, any amount due the authority, together with any other actual damages the authority shall have sustained from the failure or refusal of that city, town or regional school district to make payments owing to the authority.
