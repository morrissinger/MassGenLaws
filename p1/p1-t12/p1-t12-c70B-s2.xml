    	     In the case of a grant for an approved project of a regional school district or a county, the total facilities grant shall be the sum of the grants computed separately for each city and town which is a member of said regional school district or located in said county as hereinafter provided. For purposes of this computation, each member city’s and town’s share of the combined grant shall be equal to the total approved project cost, including costs referred to in section 4, multiplied by the product of the reimbursement percentage listed in subsection (a) of section 10, multiplied by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved.
