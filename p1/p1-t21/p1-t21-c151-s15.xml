        Every employer shall keep a true and accurate record of the name, address and occupation of each employee, of the amount paid each pay period to each employee, of the hours worked each day and each week by each employee, and such other information as the commissioner or the attorney general in their discretion shall deem material and necessary. Such records shall be kept on file for at least two years after the entry date of the record. Such records shall be maintained at the place of employment, at an office of the employer, or with a bank, accountant or other central location and shall be open to the inspection of the commissioner or the attorney general, or their authorized representatives at any reasonable time, and the employer shall furnish immediately to the attorney general, commissioner or representative, upon request, a copy of any of these records. Every employer shall furnish to the commissioner, or the attorney general, or their authorized representative, on demand, a sworn statement of such record, and, if the commissioner or the attorney general shall so require, upon forms prescribed or approved by him. An employer shall allow an employee at reasonable times and places to inspect the records kept under this section and pertaining to that employee.
