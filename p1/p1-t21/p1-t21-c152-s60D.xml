Any forfeiture recovered under this section shall be paid to the state treasurer and shall be held and expended by him in like manner as a deposit made under said section fifty-seven. Any company issuing any policy of workers’ compensation insurance while in default of such compliance shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, and any officer or agent thereof issuing any such policy on the company’s behalf during such default shall be punished by such fine or by imprisonment for not more than three months, or both. 
The supreme judicial court for the county of Suffolk shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon an information filed by the attorney general at the relation of the commissioner of insurance, to enforce compliance with any order of the commissioner made under section fifty-seven, and the payment of any fine, forfeiture or penalty prescribed by this section.
