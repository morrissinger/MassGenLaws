        A criminal prosecution shall not be begun against a person for a violation of any provision of sections one hundred and thirty-three or one hundred and thirty-four unless he has, after receiving notice from the attorney general of the changes necessary to comply with said sections, neglected to make such changes. A notice shall be sufficient under this section if given to one member of a firm, or to the clerk, cashier, secretary, agent or any other officer having charge of the business of a corporation, or to its attorney, or, in the case of a foreign corporation, to the officer or person having charge of any such industrial establishment or railroad establishment; and such officer or person shall be personally liable for the amount of any fine if a judgment against the corporation is unsatisfied.
