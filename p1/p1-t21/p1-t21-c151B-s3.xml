To obtain upon request and utilize the services of all executive departments and agencies.  5.

The term "sexual orientation'' shall mean having an orientation for or being identified as having an orientation for heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality. The commission through its chairman may appoint a single commissioner to hold public hearings, as hereinafter provided, and to otherwise act on its behalf in connection therewith; provided, however, that a person aggrieved by the decision of said single commissioner may, within ten days of said decision, file an appeal for rehearing or review by the commission.[ Subsection 6 as amended by 2011, 199, Sec. 6 effective July 1, 2012.
