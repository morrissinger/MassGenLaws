    <text>
        No system used by manufacturers for grading the work of a weaver shall affect or lessen the wages of the weaver except for imperfections in his own work; and in no case shall the wages of those engaged in weaving be affected by fines or otherwise unless the imperfections complained of are first exhibited and pointed out to the person whose wages are to be affected; and a fine shall not be imposed upon any person for imperfect weaving unless this section is first complied with and the amount of the fines is agreed upon by both parties.
