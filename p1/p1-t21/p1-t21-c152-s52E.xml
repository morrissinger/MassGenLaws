    <text>
        Any person or organization wilfully violating any provision of section fifty-two, fifty-two C or fifty-two D shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each such violation. Such penalty may be in addition to any other penalty provided by law. The commissioner may suspend the license of any rating organization or insurer which fails to comply with an order of the commissioner within the time limited by such order, or any extension thereof which the commissioner may grant. The commissioner shall not suspend the license of any rating organization or insurer for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for an appeal therefrom has expired, or, if an appeal has been taken, until such order has been affirmed. The commissioner may determine when a suspension of license shall become effective and such suspension shall remain in effect for a period fixed by him, unless he modifies or rescinds such suspension, or until the order upon which such suspension is based is modified, rescinded or reversed. No license shall be suspended or revoked except upon a written order of the commissioner, stating his findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days’ written notice to such organization specifying the alleged violation.
