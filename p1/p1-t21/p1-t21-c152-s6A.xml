The division shall monitor the furnishing of benefits by the employer or insurer to ascertain that correct benefits are being provided in cases accepted as compensable injuries. In the event of controversy or dispute, the division shall attempt to resolve the dispute promptly and informally, and, upon failing to do so, shall promptly forward a claim form to the employee.
