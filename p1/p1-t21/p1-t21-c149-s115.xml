        If it appears to an inspector that in any industrial establishment, from the nature of the work or the machinery used in connection therewith, or from other circumstances, there is danger of injury to the eyes of employees engaged in such work, and that the danger of injury may be decreased or prevented by any mechanical device or other practicable means, he shall, if the attorney general so directs, order in writing that such device or other means shall be provided therein; and the proprietors and managers of the industrial establishment shall comply with the order. Violations of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars for each week during which the violation continues, but a criminal prosecution for such violation shall not be begun unless a person has for four weeks after the receipt of a written order from an inspector neglected to comply therewith.
