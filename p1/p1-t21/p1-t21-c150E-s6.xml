        The employer and the exclusive representative shall meet at reasonable times, including meetings in advance of the employerâ€™s budget-making process and shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards or productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment, including without limitation, in the case of teaching personnel employed by a school committee, class size and workload, but such obligation shall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make a concession; provided, however, that in no event shall the right of any employee to run as a candidate for or to hold elective office be deemed to be within the scope of negotiation.
