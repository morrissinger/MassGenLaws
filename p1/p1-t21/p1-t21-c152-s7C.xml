        Any party appearing before the division of dispute resolution may be heard in person, or may be represented by an attorney or by any other person designated by such party. No person who is not an attorney shall be compensated for representing a claimant in such a proceeding; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall bar payment by a labor organization, employee association, or insurer of any payment of regular wages or salary to a full time employee for time spent in representing a claimant. The senior judge may, for cause, deny or suspend the right of any person to practice or appear before the department. Any person denied or suspended under this provision shall have the right to appeal to the commissioner any denial or suspension within fourteen days of receipt of the notice. Upon receipt of such appeal, the commissioner shall refer the matter to the division of administrative law appeals within the executive office of administration and finance which shall have the authority to reverse, uphold or modify the removal or suspension after a hearing held pursuant to section thirteen of chapter thirty A. Any party aggrieved by said hearing shall have the right to appeal as set forth in section fourteen of said chapter thirty A.
