In case of a second violation, such minor may be arrested and dealt with as a delinquent child, or, if over seventeen, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding fifteen dollars. Upon the recommendation of the principal or chief executive officer of the school which such minor attends, or upon the complaint of any supervisor of attendance, police officer, inspector or probation officer, the badge of any minor violating any provision of sections seventy to seventy-three, inclusive, or who becomes delinquent or fails to comply with all legal requirements concerning school attendance, may be revoked for three months by the officer issuing the same and the badge taken from such minor. If any minor refuses to surrender such badge, or works at any of the occupations mentioned in section sixty-nine after notice of the revocation of such badge, he shall be deemed to have violated section seventy.
