        The owner, lessee or occupant of every such establishment shall make the changes necessary to conform thereto. If such changes are made upon the order of an inspector by the occupant or lessee, he may, within thirty days after completion, bring an action against any other person having an interest in such premises, and may recover such proportion of the expense of making such changes as the court adjudges should justly and equitably be borne by the defendant.
