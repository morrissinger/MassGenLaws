    	     An award shall be made within the time fixed by the agreement or, if said time is not so fixed, within such time as the court orders upon application of a party. The parties may by an agreement in writing extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof. A party shall be deemed to have waived the objection that an award was not made within the time required unless he notifies the arbitrators of his objection prior to the delivery of the award to him.
