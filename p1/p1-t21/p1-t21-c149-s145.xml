    <text>
        The attorney general may make or cause to be made an investigation of any industry which employs industrial homeworkers, in order to determine whether the wages and conditions of employment of industrial homeworkers in such industry are injurious to their health and welfare, or whether the wages and conditions of employment of such industrial homeworkers have the effect of rendering unduly difficult the maintenance of existing labor standards or the enforcement of labor standards established by law or regulation for workers in the industry. If, on the basis of information in his possession, with or without an investigation as provided in this section, the attorney general shall find that industrial homework cannot be continued within a certain industry without injuring the health and welfare of the industrial homeworkers within such industry, or without rendering unduly difficult the maintenance of existing labor standards or the enforcement of labor standards established by law or regulation for workers in such industry, the attorney general shall by order declare such industrial homework unlawful and require all employers in such industry to discontinue the furnishing within the commonwealth of material for industrial homework, and no permit issued under section one hundred and forty-seven shall be deemed thereafter to authorize the furnishing of materials for industrial homework prohibited by such order.
