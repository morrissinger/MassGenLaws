        Supervisors of attendance, representatives of the office of the attorney general, agents of the department of education or of the department of labor, or any authorized agent or inspector of either of those departments may require that the permit for employment and lists of minors employed in any establishment or occupation shall be produced for their inspection. A failure so to do upon request shall be prima facie evidence of the illegal employment of any minor whose permit for employment or educational certificate is not produced or whose name is not so listed.
