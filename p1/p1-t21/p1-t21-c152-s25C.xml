Such order shall take effect immediately upon its service upon said employer, unless such employer provides evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner or his designee, of having secured any necessary insurance or self-insurance and pays a civil penalty into the private employer trust fund in the amount of one hundred dollars per day for each day such employer was not in compliance with this chapter, counting the date of service of the stop work order as the first day and date of payment of the penalty herein provided and of production of evidence of insurance or self-insurance as the final day.

    	     Any employer who is aggrieved by the imposition of a stop work order shall have ten days from the date of its service to appeal such order. Any employer who timely files such appeal shall be granted a hearing by the commissioner or his designee within fourteen days of receipt of appeal. The stop work order shall not be in effect during the pendency of any timely filed appeal. Any stop work order and monetary penalty shall be rescinded if the commissioner or his designee finds at the hearing that the employer has at all times been in compliance with this chapter. If the commissioner or his designee finds at the hearing that the employer did or has not provided for all insurance or self-insurance required by this chapter, the stop work order shall be effective immediately on the conclusion of the hearing and shall remain in effect until such time as the employer provides evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner or his designees, of having secured any necessary insurance or self-insurance and pays a civil penalty into the private employer trust fund in the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars per day for each day such employer was not in compliance with this chapter, counting the date of service of the stop work order as the first day and the date of payment of the penalty herein provided and of production of evidence of insurance or self-insurance as the final day.
