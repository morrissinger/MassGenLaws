        The commissioner, upon determination that there is a violation of any workplace standard relative to the protection of the general public and the occupational health and safety of workers or of any standard or requirement of licensure, may order any work site to be closed by way of the issuance of a cease and desist order enforceable in the appropriate courts of the commonwealth. For purposes of such cease and desist order, the work site may include the area where asbestos related work is being performed and other areas of the building or structure which the commissioner determines may be hazardous to the health and safety of workers or the general public as a result of such asbestos work.
