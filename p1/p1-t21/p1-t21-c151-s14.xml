        Any person aggrieved by any decision of the commissioner may bring a petition in the superior court praying that such decision of the commissioner may be reviewed by the court, and after such notice to the commissioner as the court deems necessary, it shall review such decision, hear the evidence and make such order approving, in whole or in part, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the decision appealed from as justice may require, and may refer any matter or issue arising in the proceedings to the commissioner for further consideration. The filing of the petition shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, after notice to the commissioner and for cause shown, grant a restraining order. Upon any such petition the court may take evidence without being bound by any technical rules of evidence or procedure, to the end that any evidence may be received which the court considers probative. 
If any part of any minimum fair wage regulation is severable therefrom and if such part is held to be invalid or unconstitutional the remaining parts of said regulation shall not be affected thereby, but shall continue in effect as if the part determined to be invalid or unconstitutional had not been included therein.
