        There is hereby established a separate fund to be known as the Federal Loan Interest Fund which shall be administered by the commissioner, without liability on the part of the commonwealth beyond the amount credited to and earned by the fund. Said fund shall consist of all amounts received under section fourteen J which shall be credited to such fund, except as otherwise provided in said section fourteen J and any other monies authorized by law to be credited to said fund. Money in the fund shall be used only for the payment of interest required to be paid under section 1202(b) of the Social Security Act. The monies in said fund shall be continuously available to the commissioner for the payment of said interest and shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund or account except as herein provided. On September thirtieth of each calendar year, the commissioner shall transfer from the Federal Loan Interest Fund to the Unemployment Compensation Fund any amounts paid pursuant to section fourteen J prior to the immediately preceding twenty-four month period which have not been expended for the payment of interest. The commissioner shall credit such amounts transferred to the solvency account pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of section fourteen as of October first of said calendar year.
