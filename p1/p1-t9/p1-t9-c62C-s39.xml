    	     appeals from the commissionerâ€™s refusal to abate any other tax or to refund any tax, in whole or in part, whether such refusal results from the denial of an abatement application made under section 36 or section 37, shall be made by filing a petition with the clerk of the appellate tax board. If, on hearing, the board or the court, whichever the case may be, finds that the person making the appeal was entitled to an abatement or a refund, it shall make such abatement or refund as it sees fit. If a tax so abated has been paid, the state treasurer, upon presentation to him of the notice of the decision of the board, or the court, shall repay to the petitioner the amount of the abatement and interest computed in accordance with section 40.
