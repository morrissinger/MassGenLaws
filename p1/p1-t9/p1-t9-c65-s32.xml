        The commissioner shall commence proceedings for the recovery of any of the taxes imposed by this chapter or by corresponding provisions of earlier laws within six months after the same become payable; and also whenever the judge of a probate court certifies to him that the final account of an executor, administrator or trustee has been filed in such court, and that the settlement of the estate is delayed because of the nonpayment of said tax. The probate court shall so certify upon the application of any heir, legatee or other person interested therein. Whenever the circumstances of a case require, the probate court may extend the time for payment of said tax, with interest in accordance with section thirty-two of chapter sixty-two C.
