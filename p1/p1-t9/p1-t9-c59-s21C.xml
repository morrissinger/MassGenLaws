Any city or town in which total taxes exceed this limit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (d).
        </section>
        <section prefix="d">
    	     Any city or town in which total taxes assessed exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (b) shall for each successive year until the total taxes assessed shall not exceed said limits, reduce the total taxes assessed by not less than fifteen per cent of the total taxes assessed for the year immediately preceding; provided, however, that the reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall not be so great as to require a reduction below the limits set forth in paragraph (b); and provided, further, that said reduction may be adjusted by those amounts approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e).

    	     The local appropriating authority may, by accepting this paragraph, provide that taxes may thereafter be assessed in excess of the amount otherwise allowed by this section, solely for payment, in whole or in part, of water or sewer debt service charges, including debt service charges of an independent commission, authority or district and as part of any wholesale water and sewer charges, that the board or officer responsible for determining the water and sewer charges certifies were not in fiscal year nineteen hundred and ninety-three paid by local taxes; provided, however, that water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such aggregate additional taxes assessed; and provided, further, that said additional taxes may be assessed on only residential real property as defined in section two A, notwithstanding the failure of the city or town to adopt a residential factor pursuant to section fifty-six of chapter forty, but subject to any subsequent adoption of such residential factor allowed by said section fifty-six; and provided, further, that if said additional taxes are assessed only on residential real property, aggregate residential water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such additional taxes assessed. In the case of a city or town whose water and sewer service is provided by an independent commission, authority or district which separately bills water and sewer users, said commission, authority or district may enter into an agreement with said city or town to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph, provided, however, that immediately upon collection of all such taxes assessed for payment of such residential water and sewer debt service charges of such commission, authority or district, the treasurer or collector of taxes of such city or town shall, without appropriation by such city or town, pay over the taxes so collected to such commission, authority or district less any amounts agreed upon to provide reasonable compensation to the city or town for costs incurred in carrying out the agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter twenty-nine C, chapter two hundred and seventy-five of the acts of nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, or any other general or special law to the contrary, any city or town which accepts this paragraph or any independent authority, commission or district which provides water or sewer services to such city or town shall remain eligible to receive loans and grants for water pollution abatement projects or safe drinking water projects.
