        If a city or town appoints its treasurer as collector of taxes, he may issue his warrants to collect to a deputy collector, returnable in sixty days, requiring him to collect any and all taxes due. Such warrants shall be substantially in the same form and shall confer the same powers as warrants by assessors to collectors.
