    <text>
        Such lien may be enforced in the manner provided in chapter two hundred and fifty-four for enforcing liens on buildings and land under written contracts for the erection, alteration, repair or removal of buildings or structures; but shall be dissolved, unless the person desiring to avail himself thereof, or some one in his behalf, subscribes and makes oath to a certificate setting forth a description, sufficiently accurate for identification, of the property intended to be covered by the lien, the names of the several co-tenants and the interest of each therein, the amount of the tax paid, and the amount due from each co-tenant, and within thirty days after the day of payment of said tax records such certificate in the registry of deeds, and unless a bill in equity to enforce the lien is commenced within sixty days after the date of recording said certificate. Such lien shall have priority over all liens and encumbrances arising after the filing of the certificate required by this section, but shall not be valid against a mortgage actually existing and duly recorded prior to the recording of said certificate, or against any lien existing under section one or section three of chapter two hundred and fifty-four prior to the filing of the certificate. No person except the co-tenant who paid the tax, or a person claiming by, through or under him, shall be made a party plaintiff in a bill brought under this section.
