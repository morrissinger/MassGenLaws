        Except as provided in the following section, no final account of an executor, administrator or trustee shall be allowed by the probate court unless such account shows, and the judge of said court finds, that all taxes imposed by this chapter upon any property or interest therein belonging to the estate to be settled by said account and already payable have been paid, and that all taxes which may become due on said estate have been paid or settled as hereinbefore provided, or that the payment thereof to the commonwealth is secured by bond or deposit or by lien on real estate. The certificate of the commissioner and his receipt for the amount of the tax therein certified shall be conclusive as to the payment of the tax, to the extent of said certification.
