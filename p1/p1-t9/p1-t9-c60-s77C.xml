        Cities and towns, acting through their legislative bodies, may accept a deed, in which all persons who have an interest in title join as grantors, in lieu of foreclosure to any parcel of land within the city or town which meet the requirements set forth in this section. Upon acceptance and recording of that deed, any real estate taxes and other municipal charges and liens shall be treated as having been paid, and shall be accounted for by the city or town in the same manner as if a tax title foreclosure had been completed. The procedure provided for in this section shall apply only to property upon which there are no other liens or encumbrances other than the liens of the city or town. No grantor under this section may purchase or otherwise acquire from the city or town any parcel of land acquired by the city or town under this section.
