        If any check in payment of any tax, interest, penalty, fee or other charge imposed under chapters fifty-nine to sixty-one A, inclusive, or chapter eighty or for any other municipal service rendered is not duly paid there may, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be paid as a penalty by the person who tendered such check, upon notice and demand by the city or town tax collector, in the same manner as the tax or other amount to which the check relates, an amount equal to one percent of the amount of such check; provided, however, that if the amount of such check is less than two thousand five hundred dollars, the penalty under this section shall be twenty-five dollars. Any person upon whom such a penalty is imposed may appeal to the commissioner who shall abate the same if he determines that such person tendered such check in good faith and with reasonable cause to believe that it would be paid.
