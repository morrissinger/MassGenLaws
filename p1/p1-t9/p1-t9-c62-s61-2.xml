The private financial assistance shall be used to fund expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the medical device company in the commonwealth, including costs associated with fixed assets, such as the construction, acquisition and development of real estate, materials, start-up, tenant fit-out, working capital, salaries, research and development expenditures, and any other expenses determined by the department to be necessary to carry out the purposes of the program. A medical device company that wishes to participate in the program shall file an application with the department on a form prescribed by the department that sets forth the medical device tax credit amounts eligible for transfer, the use to which the medical device company intends to put the private financial assistance to be provided, the identity of the purchasing company, the amount of the financial assistance to be provided and such other information as the department may require. No medical device tax credits may be surrendered unless the purchasing company provides financial assistance in an amount equal to at least 75 per cent of the medical device tax credit amounts eligible to transfer.
