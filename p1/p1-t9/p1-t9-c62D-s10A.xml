        The commissioner, in cooperation with the claimant agency, shall establish a program of wage information sharing with other states. The commissioner is hereby authorized to enter into reciprocal agreements with other states to share lists of absent parents who owe support payments to the claimant agency. Such reciprocal agreements shall only be made with states which administer programs that are substantially similar to the wage reporting system. The wage information sharing program shall apply only to states which have similar prohibitions and penalties for disclosure of information as provided in this chapter and only if such prohibitions and penalties apply to information which is transmitted by the commissioner or the claimant agency to the other states. The prohibitions and penalties imposed by said section forty-three of said chapter two hundred and seventy-one shall also apply to any such information received from any other state under a reciprocal agreement.
