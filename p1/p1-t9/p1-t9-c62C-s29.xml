    <text>
        If the commissioner believes that the collection of any tax will be jeopardized by delay, he shall, whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by law for making return and paying such tax has expired, immediately assess such tax together with all interest and penalties, as provided by law. Such tax, penalties and interest shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, and immediate notice and demand shall be made by the commissioner for the payment thereof. Upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, penalty and interest, the commissioner shall proceed forthwith to the collection thereof.
