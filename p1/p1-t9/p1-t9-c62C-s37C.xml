Any such settlement proposal shall take effect 21 days after its receipt by the attorney general, unless the attorney general objects in writing to the settlement. In the event the attorney general objects to the settlement proposal, such settlement shall not take effect until the objection is resolved by the commissioner and the attorney general.

The report shall include the identity of the taxpayer, the type and amount of the tax, the amount of interest and penalties, and such other information as is necessary to convey the terms of and reasons for each such settlement. The report shall be prepared on an annual basis and submitted to the attorney general within 60 days of the department of revenueâ€™s fiscal year end.
