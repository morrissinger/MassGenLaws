        If any person required to file a return, list or report of a payment to another person under section eight fails to file the same within the time prescribed by said section, he shall become liable to a penalty at the rate of one dollar for each such return, list or report of a payment to another person not so filed; provided, however, that the total penalty imposed on a delinquent person for all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed one thousand dollars. If any partnership required to file a return under section seven fails to file the return within the time therein provided, it shall become liable to a penalty of five dollars for every day during which it is in default. If any promoter required to file a report under section eight A fails to file the report within the time therein prescribed, he shall be liable for a penalty of five dollars for each day during which he has so failed to not file such report. Such penalty shall be paid upon notice by the commissioner and shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax. For good and sufficient cause such penalty may be waived by the commissioner, or a penalty which has been assessed may be abated by the commissioner in whole or in part.
