        If a check or electronic funds transfer in payment of any tax, interest, penalty, fee or other charge is not duly paid, there shall, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be paid as a penalty by the person who tendered such check or electronic funds transfer, upon notice and demand by the commissioner in the same manner as the tax or other amount to which the check or electronic funds transfer relates, an amount equal to 2 per cent of the amount of such check or electronic funds transfer; provided, however, that if the amount of such check or transfer is less than $1,500, the penalty under this section shall be $30 or the amount of such payment, whichever is less. This section shall not apply if the person tendered a check or authorized an electronic funds transfer in good faith and with reasonable cause to believe that it would be duly paid. The commissioner may, in his discretion, abate any such penalty in whole or in part.
