        Upon the death of an employee or a retired employee, his surviving spouse may continue the group general or blanket insurance coverage for himself or his dependents providing hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health benefits, until the remarriage or death of said surviving spouse; provided, that application for such insurance coverage shall be filed with the appropriate public authority and a method for the payment of premiums shall be determined in accordance with its rules and regulations; and provided, further, that said surviving spouse shall pay the entire cost of such premiums without any contribution by the governmental unit. 
Said appropriate public authority shall determine the amount of said premium which may be the entire average group premium for hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health benefits applicable to an employee, an employee and his dependents, or a premium computed on a basis considered by said authority to be equitable in relation to all insured employees and all former employees who have retired and who have continued such coverage.
