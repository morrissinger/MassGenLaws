        Upon the death of an employee or retired employee insured under this chapter, the surviving spouse, or the surviving dependent if there is no surviving spouse, or the surviving dependent if the surviving spouse subsequently dies, may continue the group general or blanket insurance providing hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health insurance until the remarriage of said surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, until the surviving dependent becomes eligible for other group health coverage; provided, however, that application for such insurance coverage shall be filed with the commission and a method for the payment of premiums shall be determined in accordance with its rules and regulations; and provided, further, that the commonwealth shall contribute the same percent share of the total monthly premium or rate for coverage under this section as the percent share it contributes, pursuant to section eight, on behalf of retired employees, subject, where applicable, to reimbursement as provided under section ten B, and that eligible persons having elected coverage under this section shall pay the remainder premium or rate. Said commission shall determine the amount of said premium which may be the entire average group premium for hospital, surgical, and medical, dental and other health insurance applicable to an employee, an employee and his dependents, or a premium computed on a basis considered by said commission to be equitable in relation to all insured employees and all former employees who have retired and who have continued such coverage under the provisions of section ten or are insured under the provisions of section ten B.
