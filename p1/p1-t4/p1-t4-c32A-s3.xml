Upon the expiration of the term of office of an appointive member, his successor shall be appointed in like manner for a term of 3 years. The commission shall be provided with suitable offices and may, subject to appropriation, incur expenses and appoint an executive director who shall be the executive and administrative head of the commission and who shall not be subject to chapter 31. The commission may authorize the executive director to appoint such employees as may be necessary to administer this chapter. There shall be paid by the commonwealth to each appointive member of the commission the necessary expenses actually incurred in the discharge of his official duties. The commission shall adopt such reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter and shall make an annual report to the governor and to the general court which shall include any modifications or amendments made to contracts executed under this chapter. The rules and regulations shall be in such form as to enable employees to understand the benefits available from the insurance program, including the cost thereof.
