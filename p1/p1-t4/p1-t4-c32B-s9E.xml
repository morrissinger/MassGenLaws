A town shall provide for such payment by vote of the town or if a majority of the votes cast in answer to the following question which shall be printed on the official ballot to be used at an election in said town is in the affirmative:—“Shall the town, in addition to the payment of fifty per cent of a premium for contributory group life, hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health insurance for employees retired from the service of the town, and their dependents, pay a subsidiary or additional rate?” No governmental unit, however, shall provide different subsidiary or additional rates to any group or class within that unit.
