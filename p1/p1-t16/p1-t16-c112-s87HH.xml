        Any person aggrieved by the refusal of the board to grant, or by its suspension or cancellation of, a registration, or by its refusal to again register him, may, within ten days after such action, appeal to the district court within the judicial district of which he resides by bringing a petition in said court addressed to the justice of the court, praying for a rehearing by the court. Upon the filing of the petition for a rehearing in the case of a suspension or cancellation of a registration, such suspension or cancellation shall be stayed pending the final decision of the court. After such notice to the board as the court deems necessary, the court shall hear the witnesses and shall affirm the decision of the board, unless it shall appear that it was made without proper cause or in bad faith, in which case the decision of the board shall be reversed. The court shall hear the petition within thirty days of the filing of it in said court. The decision of the court shall be final and conclusive.
