        Licenses shall be valid for two years and shall be renewed biennially. On or before April fifteenth every two years the secretary of the board shall forward to each licensed psychologist an application form for renewal. Upon the receipt of the completed form and the renewal fee on or before June first, the secretary shall renew the license for two years commencing July first. Any application for renewal of a license which has expired shall require the payment of a new application fee. Pursuant to the renewal, the applicant shall present to the board documented evidence of the completion of twenty hours of continuing education programs designed to improve the professional competence of the licensee. Such programs shall be completed during the licensed period immediately prior to renewal. In order to qualify, a program shall be approved by the American Psychological Association or such other accreditation program that the board may designate as appropriate.
