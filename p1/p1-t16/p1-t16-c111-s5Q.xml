    	     The department shall promulgate rules and regulations for the licensing of mammography facilities. Said rules and regulations shall establish mandatory requirements for facilities that offer diagnostic mammography services within the commonwealth, and shall be no less stringent than the most current standards of the American College of Radiology. Such rules and regulations shall require that a physician be designated by the facility to be responsible for the overall quality assurance of said facility. Such rules and regulations shall also include, but not be limited to, the following provisions: optimum exposure ranges; equipment standards and requirements; mandated quality assurance programs; phantom image quality requirements; operator training and experience requirements; annual evaluation and calibration of the mammography unit by a qualified radiation physicist; registration of the mammography facility and specific inspection procedures by department inspectors; reporting and recordkeeping requirements, as well as others so determined to be appropriate. The department may accept, in lieu of the above, certification by the American College of Radiology or other recognized organization as deemed status for licensing; provided, however, that the standards of said organization shall be no less stringent than the most current standards of the American College of Radiology. For purposes of this section, a mammography facility shall be defined as any facility, whether stationary or mobile, that offers diagnostic mammography services to any person in the commonwealth, including but not limited to, any facility owned or operated by any health care provider as defined in section one, a health maintenance organization licensed pursuant to chapter one hundred and seventy-six G or any other entity that offers such services as defined by rules and regulations of the department.
