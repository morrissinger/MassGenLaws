        The board shall examine applicants for licensure in each of the fields it supervises at such times and places as it may determine and shall conduct at least two such examinations in each field in each calendar year. The board shall establish examination and testing procedures to enable the board to ascertain the competency of persons wishing to be licensed as qualified athletic trainers, occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, physical therapists and physical therapist assistants. Applications for such licenses, signed and sworn by the applicants shall be made on forms furnished by the board. An applicant who furnished satisfactory proof that he is of good moral character and that he has met the educational and clinical practice requirements set forth in section twenty-three F, twenty-three G, twenty-three H, twenty-three I, or twenty-three J, shall, upon payment of a fee determined by the secretary of administration and finance, be examined by the board, and if found qualified, and if he passes the examination, shall be licensed to practice. 
Licenses shall expire every 2 years on the birth anniversary of the licensee. Licensees shall pay to the board a renewal fee determined by the secretary of administration and finance. The board may require specific continuing education as a condition of license renewal. The board may provide for the late renewal of a license that has lapsed and may require the payment of a late fee, an examination, continuing education, and supervised experience before issuing the renewed license. For purposes of implementing the transition to birthday renewals, for licenses renewing on or about January 2006, the board may issue licenses that expire in less than 2 years.
