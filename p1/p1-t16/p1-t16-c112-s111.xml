        A person who desires to be registered as a qualified nursing home administrator shall file with the board an application upon a form to be prescribed and furnished by the board. He shall include in such application under oath his qualifications as a nursing home administrator. Said application shall be accompanied by a registration fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. 
If the board deems the training and experience qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory and if he passes an examination satisfactory to the board, the board shall register him as a qualified nursing home administrator and shall issue him a certificate of licensure in testimony thereof. Said certification shall expire on July first after date of issue and may be renewed annually on that date thereafter. Such renewals shall be granted as a matter of course unless the board finds, after due notice and hearing, that the applicant has acted or failed to act in such a manner or under such circumstances as would constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of a license. The fee for renewal of such certification shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven.
