        <section prefix="a">
    	     Within 30 days after the diagnosis in the commonwealth of a congenital anomaly, birth defect or birth injury which may lead to an incapacity or disability, the physician making the diagnosis shall report the anomaly, defect or injury to the department on a form to be furnished by the department. The commissioner shall require the submission of such information on reported cases up to the age of 3 years as he considers necessary and appropriate for the prevention and early detection of such anomalies, defects and injuries. Authorized officials or agents of the department may abstract and record information that is required for reporting from the medical records of children under the age of 3 years and their parents. Before abstracting or recording any additional information from an individualâ€™s medical records, department officials shall obtain the approval of a duly constituted institutional review board that reviews and approves, and thereafter annually re-approves, a research protocol submitted to it by the department. The research protocol shall specify how such records shall be reviewed, how information from them shall be abstracted and reported, the exact information to be recorded, and how the information will be used, maintained and kept confidential. The department shall collect no more information than it considers necessary and appropriate in order to conduct epidemiological surveys and to develop appropriate preventative treatment and control measures.
