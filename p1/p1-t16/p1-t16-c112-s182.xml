        A. Every applicant for certification or licensing who is not a resident of the commonwealth shall submit, with the application for certification or licensing, an irrevocable consent that service of process upon him may be made by delivery of the process to the state secretary if, in an action against the applicant in a court of the commonwealth arising out of the applicantâ€™s activities as a state-certified general real estate appraiser, state-certified residential real estate appraiser or state-licensed real estate appraiser, the plaintiff cannot, in the exercise of due diligence, effect personal service upon the applicant.

A nonresident of the commonwealth who has complied with the provisions of subdivision A may obtain a certificate as a state-certified general real estate appraiser, state-certified residential real estate appraiser or license as a state-licensed real estate appraiser by conforming to all of the provisions hereof relating to certification or licensing of real estate appraisers, respectively.
