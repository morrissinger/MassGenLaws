        A. If, in the determination of the board, another state is deemed to have substantially equivalent certification or licensing requirements, an applicant who is certified or licensed under the laws of such other state may obtain a certificate as a state-certified general real estate appraiser, state-certified residential real estate appraiser or a license as a state-licensed real estate appraiser in the commonwealth upon such terms and conditions as determined by the board. 
B. The board shall recognize on a temporary basis the certification or license of an appraiser issued by another state if (i) the property to be appraised is part of a federally-related transaction; (ii) the appraiserâ€™s business is of a temporary nature; and (iii) the appraiser registers with the board and pays the requisite registration fee, which fee shall be reasonable in relation to other fees set by the board.
