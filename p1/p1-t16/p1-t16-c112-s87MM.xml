        A person who desires to be registered as a sanitarian shall file with said board an application upon a form to be prescribed and furnished by the board. He shall include in such application, under oath, his qualifications as a sanitarian. Said application shall be accompanied by a registration fee as determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven. 
If the board deems the educational qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory and if he passes an examination, both written and oral, satisfactory to the board the board shall issue him a certificate of registration. Such certificate of registration shall expire at the end of the calendar year, and may be renewed on or before January fifteenth of the following year; provided, however, that a person seeking such renewal shall provide evidence of such continuing education as the board shall require by regulation. The fee for renewal of a certificate of registration shall be determined under the aforementioned provision.
