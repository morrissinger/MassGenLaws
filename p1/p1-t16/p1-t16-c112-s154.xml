        The committee shall examine applicants for licensure as acupuncturists at least annually in such places as it may determine commencing in calendar year nineteen hundred and eighty-seven. The examination shall test the applicants competency in and knowledge of the theory and practice of acupuncture, medical ethics, medical terminology, and sufficient knowledge of anatomy and physiology so that safe practice could be expected. The type of examination shall be determined by the committee. Any applicant who fails to pass such examination may take a second examination upon the payment of an additional application fee which shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration and finance under the provisions of section three B of chapter seven, and must be so re-examined at the next scheduled examination. Upon failure of an applicant to pass a second examination, the committee may require him to complete additional courses of study as designated by the committee, in which case he shall be required, before taking another examination, to present to the committee satisfactory evidence of having completed the required additional courses, and shall pay the re-examination fee as noted above.
