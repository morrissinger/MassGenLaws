        Boards of health may make regulations concerning burial grounds and interments within their towns; may impose penalties not exceeding one hundred dollars for a breach thereof; may prohibit the use by undertakers, for the purpose of speculation, of tombs as places of deposit for bodies committed to them for burial; and may close any tomb, burial ground, cemetery or other place of burial within the town for such time as they consider necessary for the protection of the public health. Notice of such regulations shall be given by publishing them in a newspaper, if any, of the town; otherwise, by posting a copy in a public place therein. Such publication shall be notice to all persons.
