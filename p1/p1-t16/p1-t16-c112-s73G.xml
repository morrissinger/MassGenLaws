        Every licensed dispensing optician shall, biennially, on or before his birthday, pay to the board a license fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, in default of which the board may, after a hearing, revoke or suspend his license; but the payment of said fee at or before the time of hearing, with an additional sum as determined under the aforementioned provision shall remove the default, revocation or suspension. A licensed dispensing optician whose license has not been revoked but who shall have temporarily retired from practice or removed from the commonwealth for not exceeding five years but who shall have notified the board of such retirement or removal, may register upon paying the lapsed annual license fees and filing with the board his affidavit as to the facts aforesaid.
