        The committee shall require that all acupuncturists registered in the commonwealth renew their licenses at two year intervals. The renewal date shall be the licenseeâ€™s birthday, in the renewal year. The committee shall, by regulation, determine the renewal year. For the purpose of this section, the birthday of a person born on February twenty-ninth shall be deemed to be February twenty-eighth. Every renewal applicant shall complete a renewal application, as prescribed by the committee, and pay a fee which shall be determined by the commissioner of administration under the provisions of section three B of chapter seven. The license of any licensee who does not file a completed renewal application together with the fee shall be automatically revoked, but shall be revived upon completion of the renewal process.
