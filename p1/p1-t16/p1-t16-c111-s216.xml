        All fragrance advertising inserts contained in a newspaper, magazine, mailing, or other periodically printed material shall contain only microencapsulated oils. Glue tabs or binders shall be used to prevent premature activation of the fragrance advertising insert. Fragrance advertising insert shall mean a printed piece with encapsulated fragrance applied to it which is activated by opening a flap or removing an overlying ply of paper. Paperstocks employed in the manufacture of fragrance advertising inserts shall have a maximum porosity of twenty Sheffield units or one hundred and seventy-two Gurley Hill units. 
Any person who distributes fragrance advertising inserts in violation of this section shall be guilty of an infraction and shall, if convicted, be subject to a fine of one hundred dollars for each such distribution. The fine shall apply to each mass mailing or distribution and to each mass publication of a magazine or newspaper in violation of this section. The fine shall not apply, however, to each individual letter, magazine, newspaper or fragrance advertising insert so distributed.
