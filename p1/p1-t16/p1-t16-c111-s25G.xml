        The superior and supreme judicial courts shall have jurisdiction, upon request of the department, the appropriate regional comprehensive health planning agency, or of any ten taxpayers in the commonwealth to enforce the provisions of sections twenty-five C to twenty-five G, inclusive. A violation of such provisions shall subject the violator to liability for a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars for each day of such violation, assessable by the superior court. Any violation of such provisions also shall constitute grounds for refusing to grant or renew, modifying or revoking the license of a health care facility or of any part thereof.
