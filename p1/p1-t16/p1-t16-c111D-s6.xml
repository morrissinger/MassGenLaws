        The department may require the reporting of any infectious disease found in the examination of specimens at clinical laboratories if, in its opinion, reporting of such disease is necessary to protect or promote the public health. Every person who and every agency which maintains a clinical laboratory shall report evidence of any infectious disease found in the course of the examination of specimens, if so required by the department, in such form, manner, and detail and within such time as the department shall prescribe. Reports made under this section shall not be considered as constituting a diagnosis nor shall any person making a report pursuant to this section be held liable in a civil proceeding for having violated a trust or confidential relationship. Notwithstanding section ten of chapter sixty-six, every such report shall be kept confidential by the department and its employees and agents and shall not be subject to the inspection, examination, or copying by any other agency of government or by any other person.
