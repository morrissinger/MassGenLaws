        Whenever, in the opinion of the board or officer in charge of a tuberculosis hospital maintained by a city or town, the entire facilities of such hospital are no longer needed for the treatment and care of persons in said city or town suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, such board or officer may, so long as the department approves, establish and maintain at such hospital a division for the care and treatment of persons suffering from other diseases of the chest; provided, that sufficient beds are at all times available for persons with tuberculosis; and provided, further, that such division is licensed in accordance with sections seventy to seventy-three, inclusive. Subject to the approval of the department, the board or officer in charge of such hospital may, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this chapter, promulgate rules and regulations for such division, including the charges for care and treatment therein.
