    <text>
        Any examining physician, hospital, public health nurse or other diagnosing person or agency shall report to the director the existence and circumstances of each case of lead poisoning known to them and not previously reported. Such reports shall be made on forms prescribed by the director, and shall be submitted not later than three days after said person or agency first diagnoses or is informed of such case. The director shall by regulation with the advice of the advisory committee and in accordance with sound medical practice define the terms “lead poisoning” and “previously reported”. 
When a case of lead paint poisoning is reported to the director, he shall inform such local boards of health, public health agencies and other persons and organizations as he deems necessary; provided, however, that the name of any individual contracting lead poisoning shall not be included unless the director determines that such inclusion is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the affected individual. 
The director shall maintain comprehensive records of all reports submitted pursuant to this section. Such records shall be geographically indexed in order to determine the location of areas of relatively high incidence of lead poisoning. Such records shall be public records, subject to the provision of the preceding paragraph relating to the names of individuals.
