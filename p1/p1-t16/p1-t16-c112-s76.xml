        The board may register or license in like manner, without examination, any person who has been registered as a nurse or licensed as a practical nurse, as the case may be, in another state under laws which, in the opinion of the board, maintain standards substantially the same as those of this commonwealth for nurses or for practical nurses, as the case may be. The fee for registration or licensing without examination under this section shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven.
