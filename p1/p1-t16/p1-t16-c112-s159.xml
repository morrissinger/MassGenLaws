        Any person who practices acupuncture in the commonwealth without a license granted pursuant to sections one hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty-seven, inclusive, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than three months, or both such fine and imprisonment. 
The committee may petition in any court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction against any person practicing acupuncture or any branch thereof without a license. Such injunction may be issued without proof of damage sustained by any person. Such injunction shall not relieve such person from criminal prosecution for practicing without a license.
