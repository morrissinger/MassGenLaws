        The WIC program shall serve all those eligible under the Federal WIC program eligibility standards. It is the intent of this program that by July first, nineteen hundred and ninety-four all of those eligible for the program shall be served. The words all those eligible shall mean serving eighty-five percent of all federally eligible women, infants and children. 
Federal and state funds appropriated to implement this section shall be allocated to expand program operations in areas most in need of supplemental foods as determined by a methodology which shall be included in the state plan, and to fund related administrative services necessary for expansion. 
It is the intent of this section that state funds provided under this act will supplement federal funds to enable all those eligible as defined above to be served through the WIC program.
