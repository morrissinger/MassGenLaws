        The board of health of a city or town may make and enforce regulations for the public health and safety relative to house drainage and connection with common sewers, if such a sewer abuts the estate to be drained. Master plumbers and journeymen licensed under chapter one hundred and forty-two shall be exempt from any such regulation relative to license qualifications, but shall be subject to all other regulations. Whoever violates any such regulation shall forfeit not more than one hundred dollars.
