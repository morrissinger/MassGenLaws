        A. The terms “state-certified general real estate appraiser”, “state-certified residential real estate appraiser”, and “state-licensed real estate appraiser” may only be used to refer to individuals who hold the certificate and may not be used following or immediately in connection with the name or signature of a firm, partnership, corporation, or group; or in such manner that it might be interpreted as referring to a firm, partnership corporation, group, or anyone other than an individual holder of the certificate or license. 
B. No certificate or license shall be issued under the provisions hereof to a corporation, partnership, firm or group. This shall not be construed to prevent a state-certified general real estate appraiser, state-certified residential real estate appraiser or state-licensed real estate appraiser from signing an appraisal report on behalf of a corporation, partnership, firm or group practice.
