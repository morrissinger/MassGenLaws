    <text>
        The department shall immediately report any violations of standards or regulations regulating the quality of water used for drinking, domestic or culinary purposes to the department of public health. If the department of public health ascertains from its own inspection or from the report of the department that there is a violation of those regulations or standards which may endanger the public health, it may order the appropriate party to cease violating the regulation and to take whatever steps are necessary to purify the water. If any such order of the department of public health conflicts with any order of the department the order of the department of public health shall take precedence. Such an order will be enforceable by the superior court sitting in equity upon the petition of the department of public health.
