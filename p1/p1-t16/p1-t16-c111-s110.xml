On receipt of such report, or of notice of the same symptoms given by a physician, or a hospital medical officer registered under section nine of chapter one hundred and twelve, as provided by the following section, the board of health shall take such immediate action as it may deem necessary, including, so far as may be possible, consultation with an oculist and the employment of a trained nurse, in order that blindness may be prevented.
