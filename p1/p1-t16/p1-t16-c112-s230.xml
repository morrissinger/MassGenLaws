    <text>
        The board may provide reciprocal licenses for registered, certified or licensed massage therapists from other jurisdictions if the standards of registration, certification or licensure in their jurisdictions are reasonably equivalent to those set forth in section 229. The board shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementation of this section. The fee for a reciprocal license shall be prescribed by the executive office of administration and finance pursuant to section 3B of chapter 7 and shall not be less than $100. An applicant shall not be granted reciprocity if his license to practice is revoked or suspended by any other jurisdiction. The board, subject to a vote of the majority of its members, may revoke a license if the license, certificate, registration or authority issued by another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a foreign state or nation is revoked, cancelled, suspended, or otherwise acted against, or if the holder has been disciplined in that jurisdiction, if the basis for the action would constitute a basis for disciplinary action in the commonwealth.
