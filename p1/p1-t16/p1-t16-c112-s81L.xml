        When oral or written examinations are required they shall be held at such time and place as the board shall determine. If examinations are required on fundamental engineering subjects, such as are ordinarily given in college curricula, the applicant shall be permitted to take this part of the professional examination prior to his completion of the requisite years of experience in engineering work. 
The scope of the examinations and the methods of procedure shall be prescribed by the board with special reference to the applicantâ€™s ability to design and supervise engineering works so as to insure the safety of life, health and property. Examinations for the purpose of determining the qualifications of applicants for registration in professional engineering and in land surveying shall be given separately. A candidate failing on his first examination, upon application therefor not less than six months thereafter, shall be entitled to be reexamined upon payment of the appropriate registration fee required by section eighty-one K. Upon request by any applicant who is rejected the board shall furnish him with the reasons for his rejection.
