        The department shall establish a program for the care and treatment of persons suffering from hemophilia. For the purposes of this and sections six B and six C, hemophilia shall mean a bleeding tendency resulting from a genetically determined deficiency of a clotting factor in the blood. This program shall assist persons who require continuing treatment with blood and blood derivatives to avoid crippling, extensive hospitalization and other effects associated with this condition, but who are unable to pay for the entire cost of such services on a continuing basis.
