    <text>
        The department of public health, after consultation with the board, shall establish a program for low-level radioactive waste source minimization, volume minimization and storage for decay by generators. Said department shall adopt regulations necessary to implement such program consistent with the protection of public health, safety and the environment and with the promotion of responsible research and innovation. Such regulations shall require generators to avoid unnecessary contamination of items during the use of radioactive materials; to segregate radioactive waste from non-radioactive trash; and to prepare and implement plans for the utilization of all appropriate source minimization, volume minimization and storage for decay methods.
