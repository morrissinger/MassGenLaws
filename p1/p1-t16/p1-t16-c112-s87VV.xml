        No salesman who is not licensed shall be affiliated with a broker. A licensed salesman affiliated with a licensed broker shall not act as salesman for any other licensed broker while so affiliated, nor accept any valuable consideration for the performance of any act as a real estate salesman from any person except the broker with whom he is affiliated. A licensed salesman shall promptly give written notice to the board of any change of his business address, and failure to give such notice shall be grounds for the revocation of such license.
