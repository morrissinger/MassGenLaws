        All licenses shall be effective when issued by the board. The license of licensed certified social workers, including those engaged in independent clinical practice, licensed social workers and licensed social work associates shall expire on a date to be determined by the board. 
A license may be renewed by the payment of the renewal fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven and by the completion and submission on a form provided by the board of a sworn statement by the applicant that his license has been neither revoked nor is currently suspended and that he has not been convicted of a felony involving moral turpitude in connection with the practice of social work. 
The application for renewal may be made within one year of the expiration of the license. 
At the time of license renewal, each applicant shall present satisfactory evidence that in the period since the license was issued, he has completed the continuing education requirements specified by the board. 
In the case of renewal of licenses for state, county, and municipal employees, the continuing education requirement shall be waived provided that the applicant can show satisfactory evidence of his continued employment in the field of social work during this period of time.
