        The board shall issue a certificate of registration upon payment of the registration fee to any applicant who, in the opinion of the board, has satisfactorily met all the requirements of said sections. In the case of a registered professional engineer, the certificate shall authorize the practice of engineering. In the case of a registered professional land surveyor, the certificate shall authorize the practice of land surveying. Certificates of registration shall show the full name of the registrant, shall have a serial number and be under seal of the board. 
The issuance of a certificate of registration by the board shall be prima facie evidence that the person named therein is entitled to all the rights and privileges of a registered professional engineer or of a registered professional land surveyor, as the case may be, while such certificate remains unrevoked or unexpired. 
Each registrant hereunder shall, upon registration, obtain a seal of the design authorized by the board, bearing the registrant’s name and the legend “Registered Professional Engineer” or “Registered Professional Land Surveyor”. Plans, specifications, plats and reports prepared by a registrant shall be stamped with the said seal when filed with public authorities, while the registrant’s certificate is in force, but it shall be unlawful for anyone to stamp or seal any documents with said seal after the certificate of the registrant named thereon has expired or has been revoked, unless said certificate shall have been renewed or reissued. 
Plans, specifications, plats and reports whenever stamped with the seal of a registered professional engineer or professional land surveyor shall be signed by the registrant named thereon. The use of a facsimile signature stamp shall not be deemed to comply with this section.
