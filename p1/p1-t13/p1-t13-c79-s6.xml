        When a taking is made on behalf of a body politic or corporate other than a corporation described in section seven, the board of officers by whom the order of taking is adopted shall, at the time of the adoption thereof, award the damages sustained by every person in his property by reason of such taking. Such award may be amended by said board of officers at any time prior to the payment thereof by reason of a change in ownership or value of said property before the right to damages therefor has become vested or for other good cause shown. Such damages shall be paid by such body politic or corporate unless other provision is made by law.
