        If the time for locating or constructing a public improvement by a private corporation shall be extended by statute, all unsettled claims against the corporation for damages to land shall be revived, and the claimants for such damages may petition to the proper tribunal within one year after the taking effect of such statute. This section shall not apply to cases in which, by reason of a defect in the original location of a public improvement already constructed, there has been a new location thereof.
