        Immediately after the right to damages becomes vested, the board of officers who have made a taking under this chapter shall give notice thereof to every person, including every mortgagee of record, whose property has been taken or who is otherwise entitled to damages on account of such taking. Such notice shall be in writing and shall describe in general terms the purpose and extent of the taking, and shall state the amount of damages, if any, awarded for such taking and the time and place at which he may obtain payment thereof, or, if no damages have been awarded, the time within which he may petition for an award of the same, and the time within which he may petition the superior court to determine his damages under section fourteen. Such notice may be served by personal service, or by leaving an attested copy thereof at the last and usual place of abode of the person to be notified if he is a resident of the commonwealth, by any person authorized to serve civil process, or notice may be given to persons within or without the commonwealth, by registered mail or other suitable means. Failure to give notice shall not affect the time within which a petition for damages may be filed, except as provided by section sixteen.
