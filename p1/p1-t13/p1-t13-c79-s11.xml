    <text>
        If a single parcel of land taken or injured by a private corporation lies in more than one county or in more than one town, a petition for an award of damages under section seven may be made to the appropriate board of officers of either of such counties or of either of such towns. The board of officers to whom petition is first made shall have exclusive jurisdiction thereof, and shall award said damages as though the land lay entirely in one county, or in one town. If land injured by a public improvement lies outside the commonwealth, the petition may be made to the board which would have jurisdiction if it lay in the same county, or in the same town, as such public improvement.
