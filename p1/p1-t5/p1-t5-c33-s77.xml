        The senior member of a court-martial and summary court officers may issue warrants to arrest accused persons and to bring an accused person before the court for trial whenever he shall have disobeyed a written order from the convening authority, delivered to him with a copy of the charge or charges, and directing him to appear before the court. Said officials may issue subpoenas, and may enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and documents, and may sentence for a refusal to be sworn or to answer, as in actions before civil courts.
