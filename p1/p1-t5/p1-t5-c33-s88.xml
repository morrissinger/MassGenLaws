In case of death resulting from such injury, sickness or disease, except in the case of any such death for which compensation is payable under the provisions of the second paragraph of this section, compensation shall be paid to the decedentâ€™s dependents, as determined in accordance with clause (3) of section one and section thirty-two of chapter one hundred and fifty-two, in the amounts provided by and otherwise subject to section thirty-one of said chapter; provided, that dependents other than widows and children shall receive compensation to be fixed by said board, which shall exercise all the powers given by said provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-two to the division of industrial accidents. 
In the case of the death of a member of the Massachusetts National Guard resulting from injury, sickness, or disease received while in the line of duty pursuant to orders under titles 10 and 32 of the United States Code or chapter 33, and that injury, sickness or disease resulting in the death was not the result of fault or neglect on the part of the decedent, a single payment of $100,000 shall be paid to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse the amount shall be paid to the child, or children in equal shares, of the decedent. If there is no surviving spouse and no child or children, the surviving mother and father of the decedent, if the father and mother were dependent on the decedent for support at the time of his death each shall each receive $50,000. If only 1 parent survived the decedent or only 1 parent was dependent on the decedent for support, that parent shall receive $100,000. The standard for dependency shall be determined in accordance with clause (3) of section 1 and section 32 of chapter 152. All claims presented under the provision of this section shall be made in accordance with the procedure provided for under section 90.
