Whoever intrudes within the limits of the parade or encampment, after being forbidden, may be ejected, forcibly if necessary, or may be confined under guard during the time of parade or encampment, or during a shorter time, at the discretion of the commanding officer; and whoever resists a sentry may be arrested by order of the commanding officer and dealt with as provided in section sixty-six.
