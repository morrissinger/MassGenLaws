        No anti-freeze shall be sold, offered for sale, or held with intent to sell within the commonwealth unless a sample thereof has been inspected by the division and a permit for the sale thereof has been issued by the division. Upon application of the manufacturer, packer, seller, or distributor and the payment of a fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven for each brand of anti-freeze submitted, the division shall inspect such anti-freeze. If the anti-freeze is not adulterated or misbranded, the division shall give the applicant a written permit authorizing the sale of such anti-freeze within the commonwealth for a period expiring June thirtieth next. 
If the division finds that any anti-freeze which is to be sold, offered for sale, or held with intent to sell has been altered or adulterated or that a change has been made in the name, brand or trade-mark under which said anti-freeze is to be sold, the division shall notify the licensee and cancel his permit forthwith.
