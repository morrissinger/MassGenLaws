        Whenever it appears to the secretary that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, he may in his discretion bring an action in the superior court for the county in which the person is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order hereunder. Upon a proper showing, the court may grant a preliminary or permanent injunction or a temporary restraining order and may order an accounting, disgorgement, rescission and such other relief as may be in the public interest, including but not limited to the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the defendant or the defendantâ€™s assets. The court may not require the secretary to post a bond.
