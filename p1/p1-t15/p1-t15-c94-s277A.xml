    <text>
        All natural, dyed or imitation furs, and all articles made wholly or partly therefrom, sold at retail within the commonwealth, shall be plainly marked or labelled with an accurate statement of the material which they contain, together with the name and address of the seller. If such statement refers to the fur or other material by a trade name, it shall further designate it by the true name or names of the animal or animals from which such fur is taken or of such other material. In the case of fur, such statement shall fully disclose that the fur sold or contained in the article sold is dyed, or that the fur or article is made of pieces of fur other than whole skins, if such is the fact. Such statement shall contain no misrepresentation as to the place from which the fur or other material came, as to the manufacturer of the article, or as to any other matter, and shall be plainly and permanently marked or branded on the inside of the skin, or plainly set forth in a permanent label firmly sewed to the material or article or to the permanent lining of the article. Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars.
