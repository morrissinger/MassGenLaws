        The division shall establish minimum standards of strength and quality for anti-freeze. An anti-freeze shall be deemed to be adulterated if it consists in whole or in part of any substance which will render it injurious to the cooling system of an internal combustion engine or will make the operation of the engine dangerous to the user; or if its strength, quality, or purity falls below the minimum standards of strength and of quality, as established by the director of the division.
