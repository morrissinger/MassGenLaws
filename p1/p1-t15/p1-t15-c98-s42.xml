        After giving said notice, said sealers shall go to the houses, stores, shops, vehicles, or other commercial premises, during normal business hours, of a person not complying therewith, and shall test and adjust, seal or condemn in accordance with the results of their tests, the weighing and measuring devices of such person; provided, however, that no such person shall use a weighing or measuring device without first having it tested and sealed; provided further, that devices for determining the measurement of leather bought, sold or offered for sale shall be tested at least semiannually; and provided, further, that when a vehicle tank used in the sale of commodities by liquid measure has once been sealed, it shall not be necessary to seal it again while it remains in the same condition as when first sealed. A person who neglects or refuses to exhibit his weighing or measuring device to a sealer or deputy, or who hinders, obstructs or in any way interferes with a sealer or deputy in the performance of duty, or violates any provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for the first offense and a fine of not more than one thousand dollars for each subsequent offense, or shall be subject to a civil citation or order as provided in section 29A.
