        Cord wood brought by water into a town for sale, and landed, shall be measured by a public measurer; and for that purpose the wood shall be corded and piled by itself in ranges, making up in height what is wanting in length, and, being so measured, a ticket shall be given to the purchaser, who shall pay the stated fees for such service. Towns may establish ordinances and by-laws, with suitable penalties, for the inspection, survey, measurement and sale of wood and bark for fuel brought therein for sale, and may also provide for the appointment of inspectors, surveyors and other officers and establish their fees.
