        The commissioner may from time to time on an annual or periodic basis require each licensee and registrant to file a report with the commissioner containing information as the commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by a licensee or registrant in the commonwealth. A licensee or registrant neglecting to file the report or failing to amend the same within 15 days of notice from the commissioner directing the same, unless such neglect or failure is due to justifiable cause and not due to wilful neglect, shall pay to the commonwealth $5 for each day during which the neglect or failure continues.
