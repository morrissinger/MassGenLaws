        Every person licensed as a hawker or pedler shall endorse his usual signature upon his license. The deputy director shall, at the expense of the licensee, provide a means for displaying such license which must be worn in a visible and conspicuous manner on his outer clothing with the license number, licenseeâ€™s name and the date of expiration exposed to view. Each licensee shall produce his license for inspection whenever demanded by the deputy director or by a mayor, alderman, selectman, inspector of standards, sealer or deputy sealer of weights and measures, city or town treasurer or clerk, constable, police officer or justice of the peace; and if he fails so to do, or fails to wear his license in a visible and conspicuous manner as heretofore prescribed, he shall be subject to the same penalty as if he had no license.
