        A measurer of lumber in any town may apply to the selectmen of an adjoining town for a license to measure lumber therein, and if the selectmen are of the opinion that it will be for the public convenience they may, upon payment of a fee not exceeding one dollar, grant such license, and may limit the territory in which such license may be exercised. Such a license shall remain in force while the licensee holds the office of measurer in the town for which he was chosen, but not later than the next annual town meeting of said town.
