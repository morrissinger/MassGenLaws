    <text>
        The board of registration in pharmacy in the case of a retail drug business or wholesale druggist or the commissioner in all other cases may without hearing suspend or refuse to renew any registration if he finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety which warrants this action, provided he promptly affords the registrant an opportunity for a hearing under chapter thirty A. The suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings including judicial review thereof, unless sooner dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction, or withdrawn by the board of registration in pharmacy in the case of a retail drug business or wholesale druggist, or withdrawn by the commissioner in any other case.
