        The deputy director may at any time inspect and test any clinical thermometer in the possession of any manufacturer or dealer in this commonwealth and for this purpose may remove the same to such place as he may deem most convenient. Whenever he inspects and tests such a thermometer and finds it to be correct he shall certify it as correct. Whenever he inspects and tests such a thermometer and finds it to be incorrect he may condemn, seize and destroy it; or he may return it to the owner upon a satisfactory guarantee that it will not be sold or used. 
Fees, as determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, for testing clinical thermometers shall be paid to the deputy director for the use of the commonwealth.
