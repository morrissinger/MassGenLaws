    	     This chapter is not intended to and shall not be deemed to amend chapter 94E. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that a provision of this chapter is in conflict with a provision of said chapter 94E, then the provision of said chapter 94E shall control and the provision of this chapter shall not apply. If any part of this chapter would cause chapter 94E to no longer constitute a “model statute” or a “qualifying statute,” as those terms are defined in the Master Settlement Agreement, then that part of this chapter shall not apply.
