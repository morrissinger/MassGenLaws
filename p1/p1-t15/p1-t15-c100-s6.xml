        Prior to its expiration date, a license may be suspended or revoked by the deputy director in accordance with the procedure and on the grounds set forth in section four, or may be terminated by voluntary surrender by the licensee. 
Upon the expiration, termination or surrender of a license, the licensee shall deliver the license to the deputy director who shall cancel the license, endorse the date of expiration, termination or surrender and shall, after a sixty-day period from the date of delivery or after all claims made against the licensee have been satisfied or settled, surrender the licenseeâ€™s bond and so notify the surety on the bond. 
If a license is lost, misplaced or destroyed, the licensee shall file an affidavit to that effect and the deputy director shall issue a replacement license, clearly identified as such on the license and in the records of the deputy director.
