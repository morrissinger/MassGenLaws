    <text>
        In determining the eligibility of applicants for consideration for appointment to any status as pilot candidate or for a warrant or full branch pilot commission, the pilot commissioners shall adopt regulations allowing applicants who are members of any uniformed service of the United States to apply as credit any time during which the applicant has served on active duty and the time accrued shall be applied as experience toward the applicant’s required experience. Military sea service in command of a vessel shall be applied as credit toward any requirements for service in the capacity of master. Military sea service as second-in-command of a vessel shall be applied as credit toward any requirements for service in the capacity of chief mate. Military sea service in a capacity as an officer in charge of a navigational bridge watch shall be applied as credit toward any sea service requirements other than those in the capacity of master or chief mate. No person’s status as a veteran or as a military reservist, and no person’s susceptibility to recall to military active duty, shall diminish the person’s eligibility for selection for pilot candidate training or for warrant or full branch pilot commission.
