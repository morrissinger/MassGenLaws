        Prior to its expiration date, a certificate of registration may be suspended or revoked by the deputy director in accordance with the procedure and on the grounds set forth in section three or eight, or may be terminated by voluntary surrender by the registrant. 
Upon the expiration, termination or surrender of a certificate of registration, the registrant shall deliver the certificate of registration to the deputy director who shall cancel the registration, endorse the date of expiration, termination or surrender on the certificate and shall, after a sixty-day period from the date of delivery or after all claims made against the registrant have been satisfied or settled, surrender the registrantâ€™s bond and so notify the surety on the bond. 
If a certificate of registration is lost, misplaced or destroyed, the registrant shall file an affidavit to that effect and the deputy director shall issue a replacement certificate, clearly identified as such on the certificate and in the records of the deputy director.
