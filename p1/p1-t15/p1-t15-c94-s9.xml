        The director of standards shall prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary to enforce the two preceding sections, including reasonable tolerances or variations within which all weights shall be kept; provided, that such tolerances or variations shall not exceed one ounce per pound under the standard unit or marked weight. The said director, and under his direction the local sealers of weights and measures, shall cause this section to be enforced. They may seize without warrant any bread which they may deem necessary to be used as evidence of violation of law, giving a receipt therefor, and such bread shall be returned to the owner or forfeited as the court may direct. Before any prosecution is begun under this section by any inspector of standards, the parties concerned shall be notified and given an opportunity to be heard before the director. Before any prosecution is begun under this section by any sealer or deputy sealer of weights and measures, the parties concerned shall be notified and given an opportunity to be heard before the sealer and shall have the right of appeal to the director of standards; provided, that such appeal is filed with said director in writing within five days from the finding of the local sealer. When such appeal has been entered no prosecution shall be begun until the charges have been reviewed by said director.
