        If a person informs a sealer that he has reasonable cause to believe, or if such sealer has reasonable cause to believe, that any weighing or measuring device used in the sale of a commodity in his town is incorrect, said sealer shall go where it is and shall test and mark it according to the result of the test; and if it is incorrect and cannot be adjusted, he shall attach thereto a notice of that fact forbidding its use until it conforms to the authorized standard. If a sealer has reasonable cause to believe that any weighing or measuring device has been altered since last adjusted and sealed, he shall enter the premises where it is kept or used and examine it. Whoever uses a weighing or measuring device after refusing permission to a sealer to test it or has in his possession any weighing or measuring device that has been altered for fraudulent purposes since last adjusted and sealed shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars.
