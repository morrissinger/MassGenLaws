    	     Every applicant for registration under this chapter and every issuer which proposes to offer a security in the commonwealth through any person acting on an agency basis in the common-law sense shall file with the secretary, in such form as he by rule prescribes, an irrevocable consent appointing the secretary or his successor in office to be his attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against him or his successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order hereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent. A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration need not file another. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the secretary but it is not effective unless (1) the plaintiff, who may be the secretary in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by it, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at his last address on file with the secretary, and (2) the plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance with this subsection is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.

    	     When any person, including any nonresident of the commonwealth, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, and he has not filed a consent to service of process under subsection (g) and personal jurisdiction over him cannot otherwise be obtained in the commonwealth, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to his appointment of the secretary or his successor in office to be his attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against him or his successor, executor, or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, with the same force and validity as if served on him personally. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the secretary, and it is not effective unless (1) the plaintiff, who may be the secretary in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by it, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at his last known address or takes other steps which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice, and (2) the plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance with this subsection is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
