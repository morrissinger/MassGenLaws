        Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares an investigative consumer report, no adverse information in the consumer report, other than information which is a matter of public record, may be included in a subsequent consumer report unless such adverse information has been verified in the process of making such subsequent consumer report, or the adverse information was received within the three-month period preceding the date the subsequent report is furnished.
