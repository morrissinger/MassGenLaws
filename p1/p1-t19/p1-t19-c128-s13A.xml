        The Milk Producers Security Fund, established by section 48 of chapter 10, shall be for the purpose of reimbursing Massachusetts producers who sold milk to a dealer when the dealer has defaulted in the timely payment for the milk under chapter 94A, or orders, rules or regulations issued under the authority thereof, or of a federal milk marketing order. Each producer shall notify the commissioner in writing of any default in the payment within 90 days after the date on which payment of milk is regularly due. If there is reason to believe that the dealer is in arrears in his payments to producers for milk received by him, the commissioner shall give notice to all producers so affected to file verified claims with the commissioner. The commissioner shall examine all claims so filed and shall certify the amounts determined to be due thereon, and transmit the same for payment to the state treasurer under section 48 of chapter 10.
