        In order to protect the food supplies, agricultural produce, growing crops, live stock, manufactured goods and buildings, and to safeguard the public health, the commissioner may investigate the life and habits of, and may take necessary measures to destroy or to control, foxes, and rats, mice, woodchucks, and such other rodents not protected by law, as may from time to time be determined by him to be detrimental to one or more of such purposes. In performing such duties he may, by himself or by his authorized agent, with the consent of the owner or tenant, enter upon private premises for any of such purposes at any reasonable time. In order to carry out this section, the commissioner may enter into co-operative arrangements with the United States or any agency thereof, with any department, board or commission of this commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, or with any association, corporation or individual owning, occupying or possessing any property within the commonwealth. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize the destruction or control of foxes by the use of poison.
