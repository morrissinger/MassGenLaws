    <text>
        The director, either personally or through his assistants, may inspect at its point of destination all nursery stock coming into the commonwealth, and if such stock is found to be infested with injurious insects or plant disease he may cause it to be destroyed, treated or returned to the consignor at the consignor’s expense. He may, either personally or through his assistants, inspect all fruits, plants and parts thereof brought into the commonwealth from outside thereof which also grow out of doors in this commonwealth, and, if such fruits, plants and parts thereof are found to be infested with injurious insects or plant disease likely to become established herein, he may cause the same to be destroyed, treated or returned to the consignor at the consignor’s expense. 
Each person, except a common carrier, who receives, brings or causes to be brought into this commonwealth any such fruits, plants and parts thereof from such states, provinces or countries as may be designated by the commissioner, shall immediately after the arrival thereof notify the director of such arrival, and hold them until they have been duly inspected.
