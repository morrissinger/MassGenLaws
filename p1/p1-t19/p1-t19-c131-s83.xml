        Officers in charge of public buildings in cities and such officers as the selectmen designate and appoint in towns may take such reasonable means and use such appliances, except poison, as in their judgment will effectively exterminate Engligh sparrows and starlings in such cities and towns, but nothing herein shall authorize an officer to enter on private property without the consent of the owner or occupant thereof. A person shall not willfully resist such officers while engaged in such duties or knowingly interfere with the means used by them for such purpose.
