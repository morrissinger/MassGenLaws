        When the commissioner or his deputy has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of sections fifty-two to fifty-eight, inclusive, or of any of the prescribed regulations promulgated thereunder, he, or his deputy may order, in writing, that it be withheld from sale. The commissioner or his deputy may release the lot of commercial feed, or customer-formula feed so withdrawn when said provisions and regulations have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within thirty days, the commissioner or his deputy may begin, or upon request of the distributor shall begin, proceedings for condemnation. 
Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with said provisions and regulations shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the commissioner or his deputy to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which said commercial feed is located. In the event the court finds the said commercial feed to be in violation of sections fifty-two to fifty-eight, inclusive, and orders the condemnation of said commercial feed, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the commonwealth.
