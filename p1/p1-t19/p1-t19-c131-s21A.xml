        It shall be unlawful to pursue or hunt bear or bobcat with the aid of a dog. 
It shall be unlawful to hunt bear by the aid of baiting or knowingly to hunt bear in a baited area. “Baiting” means the placing, exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of any substance so as to constitute for bears a lure or attraction to areas where hunters are attempting to take them. 
The prohibition on the use of a dog or baiting may be waived by the director upon written application (1) for the control of individual animals specifically identified as posing a threat to human safety or individual animals that have destroyed livestock, property or crops, and (2) for legitimate scientific research projects that are conducted in a humane manner. 
Whoever violates the provisions of this section, or any rule or regulation made under the authority thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $300 nor more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment for each violation. A person found guilty of, or convicted of, or assessed in any manner after a plea of nolo contendere, or penalized for, a second violation of this section shall surrender to an officer authorized to enforce this chapter all hunting and dog training licenses and permits issued to him and shall be barred forever from obtaining any such licenses and permits.
