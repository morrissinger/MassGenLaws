        Each inspector shall keep a record of all inspections made by him and of his doings therein, and shall make regular returns thereof to the division, but such returns need not be retained for more than two years, and may then be destroyed or disposed of by their lawful custodian, and any proceeds received in the course of their disposal shall be paid to the commonwealth. The director shall prescribe the form in which and the times at which such records and returns shall be made, and may at any time inspect them and make copies thereof.
