A person shall not hunt deer during the exclusive archery season on deer nor during the exclusive primitive firearm season on deer as established by the director unless he has obtained from the director, his authorized agents or from a city or town clerk and has attached to the back of his hunting or sporting license, in the manner provided by the director, a stamp authorizing him so to hunt. The director is hereby authorized to issue such stamps in such form as he may determine and require such records be kept as he may deem necessary. 
A person shall not hunt migratory waterfowl within the commonwealth or its coastal waters during the open season on waterfowl as established by the director unless he has first obtained from the director, his authorized agents or from a city or town clerk, a Massachusetts waterfowl stamp authorizing him so to hunt.
