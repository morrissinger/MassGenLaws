        The commissioner or his authorized deputy may refuse to issue a certificate for any commercial fertilizer, soil conditioner or liming material, name, brand or trade-mark which is untrue in any particular or which in his opinion would be misleading or deceptive in any particular or would tend to mislead or deceive as to the constituents or properties of said fertilizer. If a certificate is issued for said products and it is afterward discovered that the certificate itself, or the granting of it, or the manner of procuring it, was in any respect in violation of any provision of sections sixty-five to seventy-eight, inclusive, the commissioner may cancel the certificate.
