        The director, upon written application to him, may issue to any person a dealer’s license under clause (6) of section twenty-three, authorizing the holder thereof to engage in the business of buying, selling or offering for sale, for food purposes, the carcasses, or parts thereof, of fish, birds or mammals protected by this chapter and tagged in accordance with the provisions of sections twenty-five and twenty-six and, as to fish, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the director may lawfully make; provided, that any person holding a propagator’s license may sell or offer for sale, birds or mammals, alive or dead, or parts thereof, in accordance with section twenty-three without procuring a dealer’s license; and provided, further, that any person licensed under clause (3) of section twenty-three, to propagate, cultivate and maintain fish, or to sell, or offer the same for sale, alive or for food purposes, may do so without procuring a license under said clause (6). 
No license shall be required of any person purchasing any such fish, bird or mammal, or part thereof, for his own personal use for food, from a person holding a license under section twenty-three.
