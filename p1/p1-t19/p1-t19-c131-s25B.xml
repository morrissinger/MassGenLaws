        If the director, by examination of a case of contagious or infectious disease or parasite of any fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian, has imposed a quarantine as provided in section twenty-five A, and is of the opinion that the public good so requires or that the protection of the fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian resources of the commonwealth is necessary or that the interest of other propagators are jeopardized, he may cause such fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian to be destroyed without liability. An order for destroying shall be issued in writing by the director, shall be directed to the owner or to any person having an interest therein or to the person in charge of such fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian and shall contain such direction as to the examination and disposal of the carcass and the cleansing and disinfection of the premises where such fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian was condemned as the director considers expedient. Destruction and disposal of any such fish, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian shall be in a manner as determined by the director and shall be conducted under the direct supervision of the director or his appointed designee.
