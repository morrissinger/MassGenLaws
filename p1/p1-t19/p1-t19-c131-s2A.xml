        There is hereby established within the Inland Fisheries and Game Fund, a wildland acquisition account which shall be credited monies received from the sale of wildland conservation stamps, the portion of the fees for sporting, fishing, trapping and hunting licenses to be credited under the provisions of section 2C, contributions thereto and any grant monies from the federal government or other public and private sources. 
Said account, subject to appropriation, shall be used only for the purchase of land containing wildlife habitat and for costs directly related to the administration of the wildlands stamp program. 
The director may contract with the seller of wildlands for installment payments provided that the total of all such installment payments does not exceed seventy-five percent of the previous yearâ€™s income to the wildlands acquisition account. Acquisition of all lands so purchased shall be made with the advice and consent of the fisheries and wildlife board. All such lands shall be acquired exclusively for protection and management of wildlife habitat and shall be available for fishing, trapping, and hunting.
