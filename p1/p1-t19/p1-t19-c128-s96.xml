        Any lot of agricultural, vegetable, flower or tree and shrub seed not in compliance with the provisions of sections eighty-four to one hundred, inclusive, shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the commissioner to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which the seed is located. If the court finds the seed to be in violation of said sections, and orders the condemnation of such seed, it shall be denatured, processed, destroyed, relabeled, or otherwise disposed of in compliance with the laws of the commonwealth; provided, that the court shall not order such disposition of such seed without first having given the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of such seed or permission to process or relabel it to bring it into compliance with said sections.
