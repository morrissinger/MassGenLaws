        Any person may apply to the subcommittee for an experimental use permit for a pesticide. Each applicant for an experimental use permit shall file with the department an application providing thereon such information as the department may require. Each applicant for an experimental use permit shall pay such registration fee, not to exceed twenty-five dollars, as the department may by regulation require. 
The subcommittee may grant an experimental use permit to an applicant therefor if it determines that the applicant needs such a permit to accumulate information necessary to register a pesticide. 
The subcommittee shall refuse to grant an experimental use permit if it believes that the pesticide applications to be made under the proposed terms and conditions may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, or if it believes that the applicant or person to conduct the experimentation is not competent to conduct such experimentation without causing unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 
The subcommittee shall revoke any experimental use permit, at any time, if it believes that its terms or conditions are being violated, or that its terms and conditions are inadequate to avoid unreasonable effects on the environment.
