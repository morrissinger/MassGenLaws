        No person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of harvesting timber or other forest products for hire or profit shall cut such products on land devoted to forest purposes and for purposes not exempted by section forty-four without first obtaining a license to do so from the director who is hereby authorized to issue such licenses, and to withhold or revoke such licenses after hearing for failure to comply with sections forty-two to forty-six, inclusive. Applicants shall demonstrate general familiarity with the laws of the commonwealth that concern timber harvesting and provide the director such reasonable information as he may require concerning the amount and type of forest products cut by him during the previous year. The fee for the issuance of such license, which shall expire on June thirtieth of each year, shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven for the filing thereof. Each licensed timber harvester shall, upon request, be provided with a copy of current laws and regulations concerning timber harvesting in the commonwealth. 
Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each violation. The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce the provisions of sections forty-two to forty-six, inclusive, and remedy any violations thereof.
