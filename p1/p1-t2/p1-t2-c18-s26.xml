        The department may, upon the written request of any person, trust, corporation, or housing authority, that operates or manages any federal, state or municipally subsidized housing or housing project, pay directly to said manager or operator the rent of recipients of public assistance by deducting an amount equal to the rent from the amount otherwise payable to said recipients; provided, however, that the department receives written notification from the code enforcement agency of the city or town that the housing conforms to the minimum requirements established by said agency. The recipient shall have a right of appeal, as provided in section sixteen, to any decision made by the department regarding direct rent payment under this section.
