    <text>
        The general court hereby finds and declares that using private contractors to provide public services formerly provided by state employees does not always promote the public interest. To ensure that citizens of the commonwealth receive high quality public services at low cost, with due regard for the taxpayers of the commonwealth and the needs of public and private workers, the general court finds it necessary to regulate such privatization contracts in accordance with sections fifty-three to fifty-five, inclusive. The general court does not intend to restrict the use of community facilities to provide care for clients of state agencies, if any privatization contract relating to such facilities otherwise complies with the provisions of said sections fifty-three to fifty-five, inclusive.
