No more than four members of the commission shall be of the same political party.

The members of the commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for their expenses actually and necessarily incurred in the discharge of their official duties. The commission shall be provided with quarters in the state house or elsewhere and may travel within and without the commonwealth.
