    <text>
        If the department is notified that a child who is eligible for department services is receiving inpatient psychiatric services, the department shall contact the child’s parents or guardians and a member of the child’s treatment team within 3 business days of being so notified, shall maintain weekly contact with them until the child is discharged, and shall, with the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, immediately begin discharge planning, with the priority of returning the child to his home or to a community placement. Not later than 5 business days after being notified that continued hospitalization is no longer clinically appropriate, the department shall determine the appropriate type of placement for the child and, with the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, shall immediately initiate the placement referrals. The department shall document its activities in assisting with discharge placement, including identification of available resources for home-based, community or alternative residential placements, and the barriers, if any, to discharge to the most clinically-appropriate setting. If the initial placement shall not be deemed to be the most clinically appropriate, the department shall continue to seek an appropriate placement. Not longer than 30 days after being notified that continued hospitalization is no longer clinically appropriate, the department shall refer the child to the interagency team established pursuant to section 16R of chapter 6A. The department shall submit a monthly report to the secretary of health and human services detailing the activities undertaken pursuant to this section, including the length of time required to place each such child in a clinically-appropriate, post-discharge setting.
