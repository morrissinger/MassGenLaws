        The Authority shall establish, in such form as it deems appropriate, a college opportunity fund, hereinafter referred to as the fund, to which shall be credited all state appropriations and other monies made available to the fund and all income earned on amounts in the fund. Monies in the fund, together with earnings thereon, may be used solely for the purpose of developing, promoting, administering or supporting savings programs and tuition agreements established under this chapter. Monies therein may be held in custody by one or more banks or trust companies having a principal place of business in the commonwealth or may be invested in the manner set forth in section eighteen, as the Authority shall determine. The Authority may pledge all or a portion of the monies or investments which are to be deposited in the fund, or any income therefrom, in furtherance of the purpose for which such fund is created. Such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind against such fund from the time such pledge is made, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
