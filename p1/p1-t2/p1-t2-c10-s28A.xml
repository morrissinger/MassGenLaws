    <text>
        Prior to disbursement of a prize in excess of $600, the commission shall review information furnished by the IV-D agency and by the department of revenue, as set forth in chapter 119A and in this section to ascertain whether the holder of a winning ticket owes past due child support to the commonwealth or to an individual to whom the IV-D agency is providing services, and to ascertain whether the holder of a winning ticket owes any past-due tax liability to the commonwealth. If the holder owes past-due child support or a past-due tax liability, the commission shall notify the IV-D agency or the commonwealth, respectively, of the holder’s name, address and social security number. Subsequent to statutory state and federal tax withholding, the commission shall first disburse to the IV-D agency the full amount of the prize or such portion of the prize that satisfies the holder’s past-due child support obligation and, if funds remain available after that disbursement, the commission shall disburse to the department of revenue the full amount of the prize or such portion of the prize that satisfies the holder’s past-due tax liability. The commission shall disburse to the holder only that portion of the prize, if any, remaining after the holder’s past-due child support obligation and the holder’s past-due tax liability have been satisfied.
