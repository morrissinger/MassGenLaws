The department shall establish whatever schedule of briefing sessions it deems appropriate to achieve these purposes, holding said sessions in such a manner, place, and at such times as in its sole discretion are best calculated to achieve these purposes. The department shall conduct its first briefing session on a proposal within thirty days after it has completed its dissemination of the determination of the council that the proposed project is feasible and deserving of state support pursuant to section seven of this chapter. The department shall give a reasonable opportunity to persons attending the hearing to discuss, comment upon, or criticize all or any part of the proposal and may ask questions of the developer, the department, or any other agencies represented at said briefing session.
