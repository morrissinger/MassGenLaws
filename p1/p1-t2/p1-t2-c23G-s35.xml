        As used in this section the words “building project” shall mean a project undertaken for the design, construction, installation, repair or maintenance of building and appurtenant structures, facilities and utilities directly by the Agency in the exercise of its powers under clauses (23) and (26) to (29), inclusive of section 3, but not in the exercise of any of its other powers, including initial equipment and furnishings thereof, but not including appurtenant buildings or structures which are required to be constructed as integral parts of the development of sewer, water and highway systems, or the design, construction, installation, repair or maintenance of any building financed in whole or in part through loans or through the purchase and sale of such building by the Agency pursuant to this chapter. 
The Agency shall not enter into any contract nor incur any other obligation for the design of a building project unless the design work can be accomplished (a) within any applicable appropriation or authorization for the project or within the project cost limits specified by any applicable appropriation or authorization and (b) without substantial deviation from any (i) study or program which must be prepared in accordance with this section or (ii) any other pre-design document which must be prepared in accordance with any other statute, appropriation or authorization or administrative directive consistent therewith, and unless the executive director of the Agency certifies in writing that such project complies with the provisions of this section. In no event shall the design work be such as would result in a change in the number of square feet to be constructed in the project of more than ten per cent from the number specified in the study, program or other pre-design document referred to in subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (b). 
The Agency shall not enter into any contract nor incur any other obligation for the construction of a building project unless the construction work can be accomplished (a) within any applicable appropriation or authorization for the project and (b) without substantial deviation from (i) any study or program which must be prepared in accordance with this section or (ii) any other pre-design document which must be prepared in accordance with any other statute, appropriation or authorization or administrative directive consistent therewith and unless the executive director of the Agency certifies in writing that such project complies with the provisions of this section. In no event shall the construction work be such as would result in a change in the number of square feet to be constructed in the project of more than 10 per cent from the number specified in the study, program or other pre-design document referred to in subclauses (i) and (ii). 
Every building project undertaken by the Agency shall be deemed to require the satisfactory completion of a study or program as provided herein before any services for the design or construction of such project may be contracted for, performed by contract or otherwise, or funds allotted, encumbered or expended therefor. 
No provider of design services for any building project undertaken by the Agency shall be selected by the designer selection board or by the Agency and no design services shall be performed for or by the Agency for any building project for which the satisfactory completion of a study or program is required prior to the design or construction of that project, unless and until: (a) said study, program, or where appropriate, both have been satisfactorily completed; (b) the Agency certifies in writing to the deputy commissioner of capital planning and operations that the study, program, or where appropriate, both, correspond to the current needs of the Agency including its current long term capital facilities development plan; (c) said deputy commissioner requests that one or more of the directors of the office of programming, office of project management, or office of facilities management review the study or program, or where appropriate, both and the director or directors certify in writing to said deputy commissioner that the study, program, or where appropriate, both reflect the Agency’s needs as stated, that they provide an accurate estimate of the project requirements, cost and schedule, that the project can be accomplished within any applicable appropriation or authorization for that project, and recommends proceeding with design, construction, or where appropriate, both; and (d) the deputy commissioner of capital planning and operations certifies in writing to the commissioner of administration that the study, program, or where appropriate, both have been satisfactorily completed in accordance with this section and approves proceeding with design, construction, or where appropriate, both. 
If either the director or directors whose review is requested or the deputy commissioner of capital planning and operations should fail to so certify, recommend, or approve, said deputy commissioner shall forthwith send notice of his decision and the reasons therefor to the commissioner of administration and to the house and senate committees on ways and means.
