Notification of the hearing shall be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in all municipalities within one-half mile of the borders of the proposed development zone, the first publication shall be at least 14 days before the hearing.

Within 90 days after the conclusion of the public hearing, the municipal governing body shall issue recommendations on the petition; provided, however, that the recommendations shall include, but not be limited to, the following findings:  (1) whether the establishment of the development zone is consistent with any applicable element or portion of a master plan of the municipality, which shall be confirmed in writing by the municipality's planning board; and  (2) whether the proposed improvements in the development zone will be compatible with the capacity and uses of existing local and regional infrastructure services and facilities.  (c) Within 21 days after receipt of the recommendations required under subsection (b), the municipal governing body shall vote on the petition to establish the development zone and the improvement plan.  (d) Upon the approval of the petition by a majority vote of the municipal governing body under subsection (c), notice of such approval shall be promptly filed with the clerk of the municipality, the agency and the secretary of the commonwealth.
