        The commissioners shall examine subjects upon which uniformity of legislation in the various states of the United States is desirable, but which are outside of the jurisdiction of the congress of the United States; shall confer upon these matters with the commissioners appointed by other states for the same purpose; shall consider and draft uniform laws to be submitted for approval and adoption by the several states; and generally shall devise and recommend such other or further course of action as may tend to accomplish such purposes. They shall keep a record of their doings, and shall make an annual report.
