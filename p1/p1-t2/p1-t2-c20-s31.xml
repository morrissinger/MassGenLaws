        There shall be established and set upon the books of the commonwealth a separate fund to be known as the Dairy Promotion Trust Fund, consisting of revenues received pursuant to subsection (d) of section 30, including any interest or investment earnings on such monies and all other monies credited or transferred thereto from any other fund or source pursuant to law. Any unexpended balance in the fund at the end of the fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund but shall remain available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years. No expenditure made from the fund shall cause the fund to become deficient at any point during a fiscal year. 
The dairy promotion board, established in subsection (a) of section 30, shall have exclusive authority to receive, deposit, invest and expend monies pursuant to section 30. The books and records of the Dairy Promotion Trust Fund shall be subject to an annual audit by the state auditor.
