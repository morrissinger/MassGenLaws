Eight members shall be appointed by the governor, three of whom shall be registered architects, three of whom shall be registered engineers, and two of whom shall be representatives of the public who are not architect designers, engineers or construction contractors. Three additional members shall be appointed as follows: one registered architect by the Massachusetts State Association of Architects, one registered engineer by the government affairs council of design professional and one general contractor by the associated general contractor. The board shall be expanded from the present five members to eleven members according to the following schedule: one additional architect, one additional engineer, and the one general contractor shall be appointed by the designated body within ninety days of the effective date of this section; another additional public representative shall be appointed within one year thereafter. Members shall be appointed for terms of two years and may be reappointed for no more than one successive two year term. The members shall annually select one member to be the chairperson. The director shall designate a representative, who shall be the project manager in the case of a project under the jurisdiction of the office of project management, to act as a nonvoting member of the board for each project under his jurisdiction under consideration by the board. No provision of this section shall operate to reduce the tenure of members of the board serving at the time of the effective date of this section, except that the director of bureau of building construction shall cease to so serve upon the effective date of this section.  (b) Members of the board shall be reimbursed for all necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of their official duties.  (c) The board shall be provided with a suitable office by the executive office for administration and finance.
