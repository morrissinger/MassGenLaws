Such guidelines shall be filed by the working committee with the house and senate committees on ways and means and shall become effective only upon approval by said committees. Reimbursements of costs made pursuant to such guidelines shall constitute complete satisfaction of the obligation of the commonwealth to assume such costs pursuant to any general or special law.
