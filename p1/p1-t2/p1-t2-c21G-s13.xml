Such agents and employees are authorized to make such inspection, conduct such tests, reviews, studies, monitoring or sampling or examine books, papers and records pertinent to any matter relevant to the administration or enforcement of this chapter as it deems necessary. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, any information, record, or particular part thereof, obtained by the department pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall, upon request, be kept confidential and not be considered to be a public record when it is deemed by the department that such information, record or report relates to secret processes, methods of manufacture or production, or that such information, record or report, if made public, would divulge a trade secret.
