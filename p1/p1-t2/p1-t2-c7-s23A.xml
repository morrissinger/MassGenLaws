        Rules, regulations and orders adopted under clause (17) of section twenty-two shall, so far as may be approved by the governor and council, apply to the purchase by contractors of supplies and materials in the execution of any contract to which the commonwealth is a party for the construction, reconstruction or repair of any public work; and there shall be inserted in any such contract a stipulation to such effect. Any appointed officer or agent of the commonwealth entering into such a contract in its behalf who fails to insert such a stipulation in such a contract as required by such a rule, regulation or order may, after a hearing before the governor and council, be removed by them.
