        [ Text of section added by 2012, 256, Sec. 1 effective November 20, 2012.]  The chief procurement officer of a governmental unit shall award the contract to the most advantageous proposal from a responsible and responsive offeror taking into consideration price and the evaluation criteria set forth in the request for proposals; provided, however, that such proposal shall be in full compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and local laws, including section 26 to 27H, inclusive, of chapter 149. The governmental unit shall provide written notice to the selected offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the request for proposals. The governmental unit and the offeror may extend the time for acceptance by mutual agreement. If the contract award is made to an offeror who did not have the lowest overall price proposal, then the chief procurement officer shall publish a timely written statement of reasons for its selection in the central register.
