        Towns which accept gifts or bequests or appropriate money for the purpose of properly commemorating the services and sacrifices of the soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen who have served the country in war or persons who have rendered military service for the commonwealth in time of war may provide for a board of trustees to have charge and control of the construction of any such memorial, and to have the custody and care thereof after its construction. In cities the board shall consist of the mayor and five members appointed by him and approved by the council, three of whom shall be veterans and two of whom shall not be veterans of any war; two members shall be appointed for one year, two for two years, and one for three years, and as the term of each member expires, a successor shall be appointed for three years. Any vacancy shall be filled in the same manner for the unexpired term. In towns the said board shall consist of the chairman of the board of selectmen, and five members elected by the town in the same manner as other town officers, three of whom shall be veterans and two of whom shall not be veterans of any war; two members shall be elected for one year, two for two years and one for three years, and as the term of each member expires, a successor shall be elected for three years; but until such board is elected, the selectmen may appoint a temporary board to serve until the next annual town meeting. Whenever a member who shall be a veteran is to be elected, the office shall be identified on the ballot and on nomination papers as “trustee of soldiers’ memorials — veteran” and only candidates who are veterans shall be nominated. Whenever a member who shall not be a veteran is to be elected, the office shall be identified on the ballot and on nomination papers as “trustee of soldiers’ memorials — non-veteran” and only candidates who are not veterans of any war shall be nominated. Any vacancy occurring in the town board shall be filled for the unexpired term by the remaining members. Such board may make such rules and regulations relative to the use of said memorials as they deem necessary. “War” as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, the following military actions: Korean, Vietnam, Lebanon, and Grenada.
