    	     such regulation may not include the regulation of occupancy, services, evictions, condominium conversion or the removal of properties from such regulation, nor may such regulation apply to any rental unit that is owned by a person or entity owning less than ten rental units or that has a fair market rent exceeding $400; and

        <section prefix="c">
    	     a municipality adopting such regulation shall compensate owners of rent controlled units for each unit in the amount of the difference between the unit’s fair market rent and the unit’s below market, rent controlled rent, with such compensation coming from the municipality’s general funds, so that the cost of any rent control shall be borne by all taxpayers of a municipality and not by the owners of regulated units only.
