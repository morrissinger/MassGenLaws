        Each fence viewer shall be paid at the rate of five dollars a day for the time during which he is employed, but his fee for services in any one case shall not be less than one dollar. Such payment shall be made by all or by such of the parties in dispute, and in such proportions, as shall be determined by a certificate in writing under the hands of the fence viewers acting in each case. If any person required to pay the whole or any portion of said fees neglects to pay the fence viewers within thirty days after the certificate has been delivered, they may recover in tort double the amount of the fees due from such delinquent person.
