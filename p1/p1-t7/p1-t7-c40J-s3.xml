Twelve directors shall constitute a quorum and the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and eligible to vote at a meeting shall be necessary for any action to be taken by the board.

The board shall annually elect from among its members a vice-chairperson and may designate a treasurer and a secretary, who need not be members of the board. The secretary shall keep a record of the proceedings of the corporation and shall be the custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the corporation and its official seal. The secretary shall cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the corporation and shall certify that such copies are true copies and all persons dealing with the corporation may rely upon such certification.
