        Electric, telephone and telegraph companies which, at the time of erecting their transmission lines, cut or cause to be cut brush, wood or timber on land which borders upon woodland of another, or upon a highway or railroad location, shall dispose of the slash caused by such cutting in such a manner that the same will not remain on the ground within forty feet of any woodland of another, or of any highway or railroad location; such companies which after the erection of their lines trim or cut brush, wood or timber which has grown up since the line was erected, and which borders upon woodland of another, or upon a highway or railroad location, shall, upon the request of the forester, and within a time limit set by him, dispose of the slash of second or subsequent cuttings if the same in his opinion constitutes a menace to adjoining property.
