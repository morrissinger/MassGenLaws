        After being authorized by the general court to establish any such reservation, the commissioners, on behalf of the county, may take by eminent domain under chapter seventy-nine, or acquire by purchase, gift, devise or otherwise, such land in fee as may be necessary therefor, and may establish, lay out and maintain the same. Any person injured in his property by the establishment and laying out of such a reservation may recover compensation therefor from the county under said chapter seventy-nine. 
The selectmen of any town instructed to petition for the establishment of such a reservation, if and to the extent authorized by vote of the town at a town meeting, may stipulate in writing in behalf of the town to indemnify and save harmless the county against all or any part of any claims for damages sustained under this section, and to contribute money, labor or materials toward the cost of establishing, laying out, maintaining and properly policing such a reservation.
