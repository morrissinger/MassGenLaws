        The 180 or 210 day time period may be waived or extended for good cause upon written request of the applicant with the consent of the issuing authority or upon written request of the issuing authority with the consent of the applicant. The 180 or 210 day time period shall be extended without consent of the applicant if the issuing authority determines either: (1) that action by another federal, state or municipal government agency is required before the issuing authority may act; (2) that judicial proceedings affect the ability of the issuing authority or applicant to proceed with the application; or (3) that enforcement proceedings that could result in revocation of an existing permit for that facility or activity and denial of the application have been commenced. In those circumstances, the issuing authority shall provide written notification to the applicant and send a copy to the secretary of housing and economic development. When the reason for the extension is no longer applicable, the issuing authority shall immediately notify the applicant and shall complete its decision within the time period specified in this section, beginning the day after the notice is issued. An issuing authority shall not deny a permit exclusively due to a lack of time for review if the applicant has provided a complete application and met all other obligations under this chapter.
