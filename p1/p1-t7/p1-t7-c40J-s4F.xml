    	     There is hereby established and set up on the books of the corporation the Massachusetts Research Center Matching Fund, hereinafter referred to as the “matching fund,” to which shall be credited the proceeds of any bonds or notes of the commonwealth issued for the purpose, and any appropriations designated by the general court to be credited thereto. The matching fund shall be administered by the John Adams Innovation Institute established by section 6A. The corporation shall hold the matching fund in an account or accounts separate from other funds of the corporation. The purpose of the matching fund is to provide matching funds to be available to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit research institutions located in the commonwealth in connection with applications by such institutions for scientific or engineering research funding from the federal government or other sources or in connection with collaborative academic research centers and for projects to support technology platforms and industry cluster development supported by the corporation, provided, however, that any such grant awarded in accordance with this section shall leverage at least $1 for each dollar granted.
