In cities the commissioners shall be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council. In towns they shall be elected in the same manner as other town officers. At the time of creating said board there shall be appointed or elected one member for one year, one member for two years, and one member for three years; and there shall be appointed or elected annually thereafter one member for three years. Vacancies shall be filled by the mayor, with the approval of the council, or by the selectmen.
