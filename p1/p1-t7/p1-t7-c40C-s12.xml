        A city or town may provide in its ordinance or by-law or in any amendment thereof, for a review procedure whereby any person aggrieved by a determination of the commission may, within twenty days after the filing of the notice of such determination with the city or town clerk, file a written request with the commission for a review by a person or persons of competence and experience in such matters, designated by the regional planning agency of which the city or town is a member. If the city or town is not a member of a regional planning agency, the department of community affairs shall select the appropriate regional planning agency. 
The finding of the person or persons making such review shall be filed with the city or town clerk within forty-five days after the request, and shall be binding on the applicant and the commission, unless a further appeal is sought in the superior court as provided in section twelve A.
