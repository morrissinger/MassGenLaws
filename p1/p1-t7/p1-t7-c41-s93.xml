        The town clerk shall note upon every bond given by a constable the time of filing. Any person injured by a breach of the condition thereof may, at his own expense, sue thereon in the name of the town, and the proceedings shall be the same as in an action by a creditor on an administratorâ€™s bond. The writ shall be endorsed by him and, if he is not a resident of the commonwealth, it shall also be endorsed by a responsible resident thereof. If judgment is for the defendant, execution shall issue for costs against the endorser as if he were a plaintiff of record.
