    	     The initial appointment shall be for a period of one year during which a person shall actually perform the duties of such position on a full-time basis. The initial appointment shall be a probationary period during which police officers shall be deemed employees at will whose removal or dismissal shall be without recourse at any time during such initial appointment.
        </section>
        <section prefix="b">
    	     Appointment subsequent to the initial appointment shall be made annually or for a term of years not exceeding three years, as the appointing authority shall determine, and such appointing authority may remove any such officer for cause, and after a hearing, at any time during such appointment. For police officers covered by collective bargaining agreements which contain standards for the discharge, termination or removal of employees, the nonreappointment of a police officer serving under an appointment subsequent to an initial appointment shall be considered to be a discharge, termination or removal and the standards shall be enforceable with respect to such nonreappointment by the procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement.
