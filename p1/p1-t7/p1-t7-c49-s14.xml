        If the division line between lands of respective occupants is in dispute or unknown, the fence viewers may designate a line on which the fence shall be built, and may employ a surveyor therefor; and such line shall, for the purpose of maintaining a fence, be deemed the division line between such lands until it is determined that the true line is in another place, and until so determined all laws relative to the erection, maintenance and protection of fences shall be applicable to the fence erected or to be erected on such line.
