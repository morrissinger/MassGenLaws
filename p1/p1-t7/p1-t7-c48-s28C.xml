        When, in the judgment of the director of the division of forests and parks, the forest fire hazard is such as to require the use of forest fire patrols in any town, all forest lands therein shall be closed to all persons except the owners thereof and the tenants of such owners or to the authorized agents of such owners and tenants and the director shall use all reasonable means to notify all persons of such closing. While such fire hazard exists, a duly authorized forest warden, deputy forest warden, chief fire warden and his assistants, environmental police officer or deputy environmental police officer may arrest without a warrant any person found within the forest lands of another without authorization from the owner or tenant thereof or without other legal authority if such person refuses to leave such forest lands upon request and such person shall be punished by a fine of not more than $100.
