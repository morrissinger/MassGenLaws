        The licensing authorities may, after hearing or reasonable opportunity therefor, cancel any license issued under this chapter if the licensee ceases to conduct the licensed business. If the local licensing authorities determine that a license should be cancelled as aforesaid the licensee may appeal to the commission as if such authorities had refused to grant the license upon an original application therefor, and the decision of the commission upon such appeal shall be final.
