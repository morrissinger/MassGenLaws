        The examiners may license without examination any person who has been licensed as an electrician in another state under laws which, in the opinion of the examiners, maintain standards substantially the same as those of the commonwealth for electricians. The amount of the fee for licensing without examination under this section for a master and journeyman electricianâ€™s license shall be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven for the filing thereof.
