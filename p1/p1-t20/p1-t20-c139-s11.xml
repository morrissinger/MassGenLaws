        If the owner of any such premises shall pay all costs of the proceedings, and file with the court a bond with sureties approved by the clerk in the full value of such premises as ascertained by the court, or, when the court is not in session, by the clerk, payable to the court and conditioned that the owner of the premises found to be a nuisance will immediately abate such nuisance and prevent the same from being established or kept therein within one year thereafter, the court or justice may, if satisfied of the ownerâ€™s good faith, order the premises so closed to be delivered to such owner and the order of abatement to be so modified as to dissolve the order that the premises remain closed for one year; provided, that such modification shall not release such premises from any judgment, lien, penalty or liability to which it may be subject.
