No alcoholic beverage which has been damaged by fire or other casualty may be offered for sale in the commonwealth and any such beverage shall be destroyed by the owner on such terms and conditions as the commission shall determine. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, beer or other malt beverage, which has been determined by the alcoholic beverages control commission, to have been damaged by fire or other casualty shall not be offered for sale in the commonwealth and shall be destroyed by the owner on such terms and conditions as said commission shall determine. Any holder of a license under this chapter may pledge or mortgage to secure a loan or debt any alcoholic beverages or alcohol which he is authorized to sell and the pledgee or mortgagee acting in conformity with the terms of such pledge or mortgage may sell, store and transport such alcoholic beverages or alcohol subject to such conditions and restrictions as the commission may prescribe; provided, that no such pledge or mortgage shall be given or made to a person holding any interest in a business licensed under this chapter. Violation of any provision of this section shall be punished except as provided in section twenty-two by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
