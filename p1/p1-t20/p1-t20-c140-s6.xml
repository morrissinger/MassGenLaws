        A common victualler’s or innholder’s license may be issued to an applicant therefor if at the time of his application he has upon his premises the necessary implements and facilities for cooking, preparing and serving food for strangers and travelers, and, in the case of an applicant for an innholder’s license, also has the rooms, beds and bedding required by law. An applicant for a license as a common victualler or as an innholder, proposed to be exercised upon premises which have not been equipped with fixtures or supplied with necessary implements and facilities for cooking, preparing and serving food and upon which, in the case of an applicant for an innholder’s license, there are not also provided suitable rooms, beds and bedding for the lodging of his guests, shall file with the licensing authorities a plan showing the location of counters, tables, ranges, toilets and in general the proposed set-up of the premises, which shall include, in the case of an applicant for an innholder’s license, a plan of the proposed suitable rooms for the lodging of his guests and a list of the beds and bedding, which he proposes to have upon said premises if and when the license may issue, together with an itemized estimate of the cost of said proposed set-up and of such fixtures, and of the implements and facilities necessary for cooking, preparing and serving food and of such beds and bedding; and thereupon the licensing authorities may grant a common victualler’s or an innholder’s license, as the case may be, upon the condition that such license shall issue upon the completion of the premises according to the plans and estimate submitted, and the decision of the licensing authorities as to whether or not said premises are so completed shall be final. For the purposes of section twelve of chapter one hundred and thirty-eight, a person to whom a license has been granted under this section shall be deemed to be a common victualler duly licensed under this chapter to conduct a restaurant or an innholder duly licensed thereunder to conduct a hotel, at the case may be.
