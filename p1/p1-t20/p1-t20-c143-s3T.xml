        The following phrases, as used in sections three U and three V shall, unless the context requires otherwise, have the following meanings:— 
“Safety glazing material”, any glazing material, such as tempered glass, laminated glass, wire glass or rigid plastic, which meets such test requirements as may be adopted by the department shall, insofar as possible, adhere to the American National Standards Institute standard ANSIZ-97.1-1972 after notice and hearing as required by chapter thirty A, and which are so constructed, treated or combined with other materials as to minimize the likelihood of cutting and piercing injuries resulting from human contact with the glazing material. 
“Hazardous locations”, means those installations, glazed or to be glazed in commercial and public buildings, known as framed or unframed glass entrance doors; and those installations, glazed or to be glazed in residential buildings and other structures used as dwellings, commercial buildings, and public buildings, known as sliding glass doors, storm doors, shower doors, bathtub enclosures, and fixed glazed panels adjacent to entrance and exit doors which because of their location present a barrier in the normal path traveled by persons going into or out of these buildings, and because of their size and design may be mistaken as means of ingress or egress; and any other installation, glazed or to be glazed, wherein the use of other than safety glazing materials would constitute an unreasonable hazard as the commissioner may determine after notice and hearing as required by said chapter thirty A, whether or not the glazing in such doors, panels, enclosures and other installations is transparent.
