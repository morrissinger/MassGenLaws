        All claims or suits brought in any court against a licensee may be brought in the name of the person damaged upon the bond deposited by the licensee. If such licensee has departed from the commonwealth with the intent to defraud his creditors or to avoid the service of summons in any action brought under this section, or if the presence within the commonwealth of such licensee cannot be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence, service shall be made upon the surety and by mailing one copy of the summons to the last known post office address or residence of the licensee within or without the commonwealth and a copy of the summons to the place where he conducted such employment agency as shown by the records of the commissioner.
