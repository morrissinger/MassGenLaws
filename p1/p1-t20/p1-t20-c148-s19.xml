        Before the issue of a permit to use an explosive in the blasting of rock or any other substance as prescribed by the department, the applicant for the permit shall file with the clerk of the city or town where the blasting is to be done a bond running to the city or town, with sureties approved by the treasurer thereof, for such penal sum, not exceeding ten thousand dollars, as the marshal or the officer granting the permit shall determine to be necessary in order to cover the risk of damage that might ensue from the blasting or its keeping therefor; provided, that the marshal or the officer granting the permit may determine that a single and blanket bond in a penal sum not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars is sufficient to cover the risk of damage from all blasting operations of the applicant, either under the permit so issued or under future permits to use explosives in blasting operations. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of any loss, damage or injury resulting to persons or property by reason of such blasting or keeping. Such applicant shall pay to said clerk at the time of filing of the said bond the fee provided by clause (15) of section thirty-four of chapter two hundred and sixty-two.
