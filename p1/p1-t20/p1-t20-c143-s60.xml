        The supreme judicial court or the superior court may restrain the illegal placing, maintenance or use of any building, structure or other thing. It may, upon the petition of a city or town or of a local inspector for such relief, require the removal of any such building, structure or other thing by the owner, and may authorize the city or town or such local inspector, in default of such removal by the owner, to remove it at the ownerâ€™s expense. Upon such a petition there shall be no presumption except in Boston that the defendant acted without a license or authority.
