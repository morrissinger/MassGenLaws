        [ Text of section added by 2011, 194, Sec. 16 effective November 22, 2011.]  (a) The commission shall deny an application for a gaming license or a license for a key gaming employee issued under this chapter, if the applicant: (i) has been convicted of a felony or other crime involving embezzlement, theft, fraud or perjury; (ii) submitted an application for a license under this chapter that contains false or misleading information; (iii) committed prior acts which have not been prosecuted or in which the applicant was not convicted but form a pattern of misconduct that makes the applicant unsuitable for a license under this chapter; or (iv) has affiliates or close associates that would not qualify for a license or whose relationship with the applicant may pose an injurious threat to the interests of the commonwealth in awarding a gaming license to the applicant.  (b) The commission shall deny an application for a license or registration, other than a gaming license or a license for a key gaming employee,under this chapter if the applicant: (i) has been convicted of a felony or other crime involving embezzlement, theft, fraud or perjury; provided, however, that for convictions which occurred before the 10-year period immediately preceding application for licensure, an applicant may demonstrate, and the commission shall consider, the applicant's rehabilitation and whether such conviction should not be an automatic disqualification under this section; (ii) submitted an application for a license under this chapter that contains false or misleading information; (iii) committed prior acts which have not been prosecuted or in which the applicant was not convicted but form a pattern of misconduct that makes the applicant unsuitable for a license under this chapter; or (iv) has affiliates or close associates that would not qualify for a license or whose relationship with the applicant may pose an injurious threat to the interests of the commonwealth in awarding a gaming license to the applicant.
