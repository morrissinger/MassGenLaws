The board may, in accordance with the provisions of this section and sections nineteen H to nineteen K, inclusive, provide grant funds to such cities and towns which apply for funding of projects authorized by this section; provided, however, that said grant shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the cost of an approved library project, including interest and the cost of planning thereof.
