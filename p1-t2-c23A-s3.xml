The director of broadband development shall work in consultation with Massachusetts Broadband Institute, established by section 6B of chapter 40J of the General Laws. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a), the director of wireless and broadband development shall have extensive experience in the broadband, telecommunications or data communications industry, including, but not limited to, the utilization of market-based strategies to induce wireless internet, cellular or broadband deployment, the creation of public entities to facilitate wireless internet, cellular and broadband deployment, and a demonstrated knowledge of state-of-the-art technologies that bring wireless internet, cellular and broadband to underserved areas, including, but not limited to, wireless technologies. The director of wireless and broadband development shall annually, no later than December 31, submit a report, including any recommendations for legislation, to the secretary of the executive office of economic development, the director of the department of business and technology, the commissioner of telecommunications and cable, the chairpersons of the house and senate committees on ways and means, the chairpersons of the joint committee on economic development and emerging technologies and the chairpersons of the joint committee on telecommunications, utilities and energy.[ Subsection (c) added by 2012, 238, Sec. 6 effective August 7, 2012.]  (c) MOBD, with assistance from the office of small business and entrepreneurship, and in consultation with the secretary of housing and economic development, the office of consumer affairs and business regulation and the department of housing and community development, shall develop, operate and maintain a searchable website accessible by the public at no cost, to provide information on public and private resources available to small businesses and to promote small businesses in the commonwealth.
