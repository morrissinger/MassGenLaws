        The commission may license the maintenance of those parts of buildings and of the foundations of buildings which on July first, nineteen hundred and ten, projected into, upon or over the embankment of the Charles river basin. Said licenses shall be granted upon such terms, conditions, restrictions and agreements, and for such period of years, not exceeding 5, as the commission may deem best; provided, that licenses shall be revocable at any time by the commission. The granting of such a license shall in no event be construed to create in the licensee any title to the land into, upon or over which any licensed encroachment shall project, and no person shall by the maintenance of parts of buildings or foundations of buildings herein described, with or without such license, acquire any rights by prescription or adverse possession in any part of the Charles river embankment.
