        Whenever it appears that a female confined in any correctional facility, is about to give birth to a child, the physician of the institution where the inmate is confined shall send to the commissioner a certificate of her condition, and the commissioner shall thereupon order her removal to a hospital near the institution where she is confined, but in no case shall such female be removed to the Tewksbury hospital or to any penal or reformatory institution for the purpose of giving birth. An inmate so removed shall be kept in such hospital until the physician thereof shall certify to said commissioner that she may safely be removed, whereupon the commissioner shall issue an order for her return to the correctional facility.
