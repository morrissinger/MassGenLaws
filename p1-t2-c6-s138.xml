        The commissioner, upon written application stating the purpose and manner of raising funds, the time during which it is proposed to solicit, and the time and place of any proposed entertainment or game, may issue licenses to raise funds for the benefit of the blind. He may order a hearing on any such application, and may require such public notice thereof to be given as he deems expedient. If the commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing that a violation of law is intended, or that the granting of the license will not be for the public interest, he may refuse to issue the same. Every such license shall contain the name of the applicant, the purpose for which it is granted, and the period, which shall not exceed one year, for which it is issued. Any person aggrieved by the refusal of the commissioner to issue such a license may appeal to the advisory board of the commission, whose decision shall be final.
