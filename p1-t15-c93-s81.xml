        Every contract for health club services shall provide clearly and conspicuously in writing that such contract may be cancelled within three business days after the date of receipt by the buyer of a copy of the written contract or written receipt indicating the buyer’s payment for health club services. The contract for health club services shall contain the following written notice in at least ten point bold type: 
“CONSUMER’S RIGHT TO CANCELLATION. YOU MAY CANCEL THIS CONTRACT WITHOUT ANY PENALTY OR FURTHER OBLIGATION BY CAUSING A WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR CANCELLATION TO BE DELIVERED IN PERSON OR POSTMARKED BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED UNITED STATES MAIL WITHIN THREE (3) BUSINESS DAYS OF THE DATE OF THIS CONTRACT OR THE DATE OF YOUR RECEIPT TO THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS CONTRACT.” 
Notice of the buyer’s right to cancel and the method of cancellation under this section shall also be posted clearly and conspicuously on the premises of the health club. 
The notice of the buyer’s cancellation of his contract shall be in writing and delivered in person or by certified or registered United States mail at the address specified in the contract. Such notice shall be accompanied by the contract forms, membership cards and any other documents or evidence of membership previously delivered to the buyer. All monies paid pursuant to such contract shall be refunded within fifteen business days of receipt of such notice of cancellation. If the buyer has executed any credit or loan agreement to pay for all or part of the health club services, any such negotiable instrument shall be void upon cancellation under this section and shall also be returned to the buyer within said fifteen days.
