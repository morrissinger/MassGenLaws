        Upon application of a vendor, the commissioner may issue a classified permit establishing such vendorâ€™s percentage of exempt sales. Such classified permits may be amended or revoked as to classification whenever the commissioner shall determine that the percentage of exempt sales is inaccurate or that such classification is not appropriate.
