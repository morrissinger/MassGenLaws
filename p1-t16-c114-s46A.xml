Such affidavit shall set forth, as far as is known to the person executing it, the name and last known address of the deceased, the date and place of his or her birth, the date, place and cause of his or her death, a summary of his or her service record, and a detailed statement of the location of the burial or other disposition of his or her body.[ Second paragraph effective until May 31, 2012.
