        <section prefix="c">
    	     Every cigar retailer shall be liable for the collection of the excise on all cigars or smoking tobacco in his possession at any time, upon which the excise has not been paid by a cigar distributor, and the failure of any cigar retailer to produce or exhibit to the commissioner or his authorized representative, upon demand, an invoice by a cigar distributor for any cigars or smoking tobacco in his possession, shall be presumptive evidence that the excise thereon has not been paid and that such cigar retailer is liable for the collection of the excise thereon.
