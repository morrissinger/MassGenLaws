        A sheriff shall not be arrested upon mesne process or execution in a civil action. If judgment is rendered against him, either in his official or private capacity, the execution shall issue against his goods, chattels and land, but not against his body. If such execution is returned unsatisfied, the creditor may file with the governor and council an attested copy of the execution and return, and notify the sheriff. If he does not, within thirty days after such notice, pay to the creditor the whole amount of his debt, with reasonable costs of the copies and notice, the governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall remove him from office. After the appointment of his successor, the clerk of the court from which any execution against him has issued, upon the return thereof unsatisfied, shall issue alias executions in common form, as well against the body as against the goods, chattels and land.
