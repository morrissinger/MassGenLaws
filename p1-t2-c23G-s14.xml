        Whenever the United States shall give notice that any lands, or any interest therein, are available for disposal or make advertisement for bids with respect to such lands, or such interest, the Agency as successor to the Massachusetts government land bank, may take whatever steps are required by federal law or regulations to acquire such lands, or such interest; provided, however, that the Agency shall, within one year from such notice or such advertisement, make no offer or bid to acquire such lands in competition with that of any municipality or municipalities, or any designee thereof, within which such land lies, unless such offer or bid is necessary, in the judgment of the Agency, to prevent acquisition of such lands, or such interest, other than by such municipality or municipalities, or any designee thereof, or the Agency. Upon the recording of a deed conveying to the Agency all of the interest of the United States of America in and to any lands included within the United States Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, title to which was granted by the commonwealth to the United States of America by and pursuant to chapter 535 of the acts of 1941, all right, title and interest of the commonwealth in and to any such lands shall pass to the Agency.
