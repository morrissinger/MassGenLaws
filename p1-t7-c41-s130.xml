        The provisions of section one hundred and twenty-seven and sections one hundred and twenty-nine to one hundred and thirty-two, inclusive, as they apply to towns, town offices and town officers shall be applicable to districts and for this purpose the word “selectmen” shall be construed to mean “commissioner” or “member of the prudential committee”, and other references to specific town offices or officers shall be construed as meaning the equivalent office or officer, if any, in a district. For the purpose of determining whether a person is eligible to apply for tenure in a town office or in a district office and for the purpose of determining whether a person has lost his tenure in such an office, offices in a district shall be deemed to be offices in the town in which they are located.
