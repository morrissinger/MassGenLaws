        Any person hospitalized at the treatment center may be discharged therefrom by the superintendent at any time he determines that it is in the best interest of the patient and of the public health so to do. 
The superintendent may also declassify the patient as under the care and custody of this center and transfer him to an open ward at the same hospital, or transfer him to another sanatorium or hospital, state, county, municipal or private, if he deems it in the best interest of the patient and the public health. The admission of the patient to such other institutions shall be in accordance with the requirements of law for admission to such institutions.
