        Except as otherwise provided by special law or a charter adopted or revised or amended under Sections two, three or four of Article LXXXIX of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, a town may provide by charter or by-law that the election of town officials and other matters to be determined by ballot shall take place in February, March, April, May or June before or after the annual meeting held for the transaction of other business, provided said annual meeting for the transaction of other business is also held or commences in February, March, April, May or June. The time and place of holding such election and vote and meeting for the transaction of other business may be stated in one warrant for the annual town meeting if called within thirty-five days of each other and such election and vote shall be deemed parts of the annual town meeting. If the election and other matters to be determined upon by ballot and the annual meeting for the transaction of other business are more than thirty-five days apart, separate warrants shall be used.
