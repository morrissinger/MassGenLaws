        Within six weeks after receipt of a request pursuant to section twenty-two, the administrator shall, subject to the provisions of this section, conduct such review, render a decision, and send a copy of such decision to the applicant. If the administrator finds that an error was made in the marking of the applicant’s answer to an essay question, or in the marking of the applicant’s training and experience, or in the finding that the applicant did not meet the entrance requirements for appointment to the position, the administrator shall make any necessary adjustment to correct such error. 
The administrator may refuse to conduct a review pursuant to this section where the grade of the applicant in any subject of the written examination is less than fifty per cent or the applicant has failed to file the request for review within the required time or in the required form.
