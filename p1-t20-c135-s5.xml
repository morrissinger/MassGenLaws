        When a common carrier has transported fresh meats, fresh fish, shellfish, fruit or vegetables to their destination, such carrier may, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, after notice to the owner or consignee thereof of the arrival of such goods and his refusal or omission to pay the freight and proper charges thereon and to receive and take them away, or without such notice and refusal or omission if such owner or consignee thereof cannot, on reasonable inquiry, be found, sell the same at public or private sale without advertising. The proceeds thereof, after deducting the amount of the freight thereon and the charges and expenses of sale, shall be paid to the owner or consignee.
