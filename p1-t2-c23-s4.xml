        [ Text of section effective until March 27, 2011. Repealed by 2011, 3, Sec. 23.]  The director may employ, for periods not exceeding ninety days, such experts as may be necessary to assist the department in the performance of any duty imposed upon it by law, and such employment shall be exempt from chapter 31. Except as otherwise provided, the director may employ and remove such inspectors, investigators, clerks and other assistants as the work of the department may require. Such number of inspectors as the commissioner may deem necessary shall be persons who, before their employment as such, have had at least three years' experience as building construction workmen. The commissioner may require that certain inspectors in the department, not more than seven in number, shall be persons qualified by training and experience in matters relating to health and sanitation. All inspectors and other permanent employees of the department shall devote their whole time to the affairs of the department. All directors and inspectors and such other employees as may be designated by the commissioner shall, before entering upon their duties, be sworn to the faithful performance thereof. The number of inspectors heretofore authorized by law may be increased only with the approval of the governor and the council.
