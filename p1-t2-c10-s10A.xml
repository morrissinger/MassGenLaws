    <text>
        The state treasurer shall whenever possible, establish a preference in the deposit of the commonwealthâ€™s cash reserves to those lending and banking institutions that exceed the statewide average for lending to small businesses, as defined in section 57 of chapter 23A; provided, however, that this shall not prohibit the treasurer from depositing and investing said reserves in such a manner as to secure the highest rate of return available consistent with the safety of said reserves.
