        For the purpose of administering the provisions of this chapter, personnel or agents of the department and its inspectors shall have access and entry at reasonable times to any premises pursuant to a search warrant duly issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that no sample of a pesticide obtained in the course of such inspection and no result of any analysis or test of any such sample shall be received in evidence in any criminal proceeding under this chapter unless the sample shall have been taken and the analysis or test conducted by a chemist in the agricultural extension service of the University of Massachusetts authorized by the department. Personnel or agents of the department may take such samples as are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of their investigation and inspection. Any information relating to secret processes, methods of manufacture, production or use obtained in the course of such inspection shall be kept confidential upon request, when not required to be disclosed incident to the enforcement of this chapter. This section shall not be construed to abrogate any of the powers and duties, as defined by general or special law or common law, of any agency or political subdivision of the commonwealth.
