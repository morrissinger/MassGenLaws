        The assessors shall, within a reasonable time, commit the tax list with their warrant to the collector of taxes, and, if there is a fire, water, light or improvement district in the town, they shall commit to him a separate list and warrant for the district taxes. If no collector has been chosen, they shall commit such list with their warrants, to a constable; or, if there is no constable, to the sheriff or his deputy; but the assessors of a town shall not commit a tax list to the collector until the bonds of such collector and of the town treasurer have been given and approved as required by law.
