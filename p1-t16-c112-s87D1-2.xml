        Whenever, as a result of an investigation or otherwise, the board believes that any person or firm has engaged, or is about to engage, in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of section eighty-seven D, the board may make application to the appropriate court for an order enjoining such acts or practices, and upon a showing by the board that such person or firm has engaged, or is about to engage, in any such acts or practices, an injunction, restraining order or other order as may be appropriate shall be granted by such court. 
Whenever, by reason of an investigation, the board has reason to believe that any person or firm has knowingly engaged in acts or practices which constitute a violation of section eighty-seven D, the board may bring its information to the attention of the attorney general, or other appropriate law enforcement officer, who may, in his discretion, cause appropriate criminal proceedings to be brought thereon. 
In any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, evidence of the commission of a single act prohibited by said provisions shall be sufficient to justify a penalty, injunction, restraining order or conviction, respectively, without evidence of a general course of conduct.
