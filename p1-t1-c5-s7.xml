        [ Text of section effective until January 1, 2013. Repealed by 2012, 165, Sec. 10. See 2012, 165, Sec. 137.]  The state secretary shall furnish to each town of the commonwealth, to be preserved in a public place therein, one copy of each of such reports included in the public document series as the town clerk may apply for. He shall furnish one copy of each of said reports to such public and other libraries as may apply therefor. If the supervisor of public records shall report to the state secretary that such town is unable to make suitable provision for the care and use of the documents, he may discontinue sending them to such town. Each member of the general court and of the executive department, the clerk of each branch of the general court and each reporter assigned to either branch may, upon a written request signed by him and delivered to the state secretary, receive a copy of any such document. Ten copies shall be placed in the state library for the use of the library and for exchange.
