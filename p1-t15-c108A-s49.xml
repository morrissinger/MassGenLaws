        A registered limited liability partnership shall be deemed to be in good standing with the secretary of the commonwealth if such registered limited liability partnership appears from the records of said secretary to have been duly registered and has filed all annual reports and paid all fees then due to the secretary of the commonwealth, and the registration of the registered limited liability partnership has not been withdrawn or revoked pursuant to subsection (5) or (6) of section forty-five. Upon the request of any person and payment of such fee as may be prescribed by law, the state secretary shall issue a certificate stating, in substance, as to any registered limited liability partnership meeting the requirements of this section, that such registered limited liability partnership appears from the records in his office to exist and to be in good standing, and the identity of any and all partners authorized to act with respect to real property instruments who are named in the registration of the registered limited liability partnership, as amended.
