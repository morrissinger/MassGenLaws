        Any bovine animal which reacts to a tuberculin test shall immediately be tagged for identification by the veterinarian, who has applied such test, by inserting into the external ear of the reacting animal a special metal tag provided by the director. Any person who removes any such tag attached as above provided, or who in any way disposes of any animal which has reacted to a tuberculin test except for the purpose of immediate slaughter, or who neglects or refuses to have slaughtered a reacting animal sold to him for that purpose, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days.
