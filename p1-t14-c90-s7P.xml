        No person shall alter, modify or change the height of a motor vehicle with an original manufacturer’s gross vehicle weight rating of up to and including ten thousand pounds, by elevating or lowering the chassis or body by more than two inches above or below the original manufacturer’s specified height by use of so-called “shackle lift kits” for leaf springs or by use of lift kits for coil springs, tires, or any other means or device. 
The registrar shall establish rules and regulations for such changes in the height of motor vehicles beyond said two inches. No motor vehicle that has been so altered, modified or changed beyond the provisions of this section or the rules and regulations established by the registrar shall be operated on any way.
