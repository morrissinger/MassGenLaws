        Examinations for licensed alcohol and drug counselors shall be conducted at least twice a year at times and places designated by the department. Examinations shall be written; provided, however, that portions thereof may be conducted orally. A person who has failed an examination may be admitted to the next subsequent examination. 
The department may accept, in lieu of its own examination, a current certificate of any recognized certifying body issued on the basis of an examination satisfactory to the department; provided, however, that the standards of such body shall be at least as stringent as those established by the department.
