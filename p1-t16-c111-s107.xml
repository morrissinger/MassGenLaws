        No person shall convey or cause to be conveyed through or from any town in the commonwealth the body of any person who has died from any disease dangerous to the public health, except in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be made from time to time by the department. No town clerk, or clerk or agent of the board of health, shall give a permit for the removal of such a body until he has received from the board of health of the town where the death occurred a certificate stating the cause of death, and that said body has been prepared so as to preclude danger of contagion or infection by its transportation. The certificate shall be delivered to the agent or person receiving the body. The department shall formulate such rules and regulations pertaining to funerals of all persons dying from any disease dangerous to the public health as it deems necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Whoever violates any provision of this section or any rule or regulation made hereunder shall forfeit not more than twenty-five dollars.
