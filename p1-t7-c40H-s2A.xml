    	     The director of housing and community development shall establish and maintain a list of organizations that have been certified as CDCs consistent with this chapter and develop a process for certifying those organizations; provided, however, that the organizations shall be recertified at least once every 4 years. The process shall include an analysis of the organization’s governance and a determination of whether the organization’s constituency, including low and moderate income persons, is meaningfully represented on the board of directors of the organization. In making such determination, the director shall consider the following criteria: (i) the percentage, if any, of the board that is elected by the general membership; (ii) the percentage of the board members who are residents of the service area; (iii) the percentage of board members that are persons of low or moderate income; (iv) the racial and ethnic composition of the board in comparison to the racial and ethnic composition of the community that the organization serves; (v) other mechanisms, including committees, membership meetings and others that the organization uses to ensure that the organization’s constituency has a meaningful role in the governance and direction of the organization; and (vi) other criteria as determined by the director of housing and community development.
