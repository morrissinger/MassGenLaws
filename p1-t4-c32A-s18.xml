        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, all retirees, their spouses and dependents insured or eligible to be insured under sections five, ten B and twelve, if enrolled in medicare part A at no cost to the retiree, spouse or dependents, or eligible for coverage thereunder at no cost to the retiree, spouse or dependents, shall be required to transfer to a medicare health benefits supplement plan offered by the commission under section ten C or section fourteen; provided, that benefits under said plan and medicare part A and part B together shall be of comparable actuarial value to those under the retireeâ€™s existing coverage. Each retiree shall provide the commission, in such form as the commission shall prescribe, such information as is necessary to transfer to a medicare health benefits supplement plan. If a retiree does not submit the information required, he shall no longer be eligible for his existing health coverage. The commonwealth shall pay any medicare part B premium penalty assessed by the federal government on said retirees, spouses and dependents as a result of enrollment in medicare part B at the time of transfer into the medicare health benefits supplement plan.
