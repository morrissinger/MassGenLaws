        A dispensing optician as referred to in sections seventy-three D to seventy-three L, inclusive, is a person who prepares and dispenses lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses and appliances thereto to the intended wearer thereof on written prescriptions from a duly registered physician or optometrist, and, in accordance with such prescriptions, interprets, measures, adapts, fits and adjusts such lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses or appliances thereto to the human face for the aid or correction of visual or ocular anomalies of the human eyes. The services, lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses and appliances shall be dispensed, furnished or supplied to the intended wearer or user thereof only upon prescription issued by such physician or optometrist and only after the dispensing optician has verified that any such lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses and appliances thereto conform to such prescription; but duplications, replacements, reproductions or repetitions may be done at retail without prescription, in which event any such act shall be construed as that of a dispensing optician as if performed on the basis of the original written prescription.
