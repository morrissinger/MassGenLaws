Such trust or trusts shall be established to receive fifty percent of the proceeds accruing to an agency as a result of revenues produced by one or more approved asset management projects. The remainder of the proceeds shall be deposited in the General Fund. The administrator in charge of each such state agency shall serve as sole trustee of said trust or trusts, and shall administer the trust so as to advance the purposes served by the agency. No expenditures from said trusts shall be made without the authorization from the secretary of the executive office of administration and finance. All expenditures from said trust funds shall conform to standard state accounting procedures and to such further requirements as prescribed by the comptroller.
