        A political action committee may accept contributions of money from individual contributors by direct deposit of funds into the committee’s bank account by wire transfer or other electronic means; provided, however, that said contributor provides the political action committee with a true copy of the signed authorization card provided by the contributor to the contributor’s employer, or the contributor’s bank or other financial institution. Said authorization card shall include (1) the name and residential address of the contributor, (2) the occupation and employer or employers of any contributor whose authorization card authorizes a contribution of two hundred dollars or more or periodic contributions which in the aggregate exceed or may exceed two hundred dollars or more within any one calendar year, and (3) the amount and payment period, if any, of each contribution. In addition, the authorization card shall include a statement that the contributor’s authorization may be revoked by the contributor at any time by written notice from the contributor to the contributor’s employer, or the contributor’s bank or other financial institution.
