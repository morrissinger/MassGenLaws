Each gaming licensee shall make readily available all documents, materials, equipment, personnel and any other items requested during an investigation; provided, however, that material that the gaming licensee considers a trade secret or detrimental to the gaming licensee if it were made public may, with the commission's approval, be protected from public disclosure and the gaming licensee may require nondisclosure agreements with the commission before disclosing such material;  (8) cooperate with the commission and the attorney general with respect to the investigation of any criminal matter; provided, however, that the gaming licensee shall, upon receipt of a criminal or civil process compelling testimony or production of documents in connection with a civil or criminal investigation, immediately disclose such information to the commission;
