    <order_by>35</order_by>
    <text>
        Any town, and any district, or regional school district, at a meeting legally called therefor, may petition the director for an audit of its accounts or for the installation of an accounting system; and said director, as soon as possible after the receipt of such petition, shall cause such audit to be made or system of accounts to be installed. Any town or district, at a meeting legally called therefor, after such accounting system has been installed, may petition for subsequent audits, or may provide in its by-laws for periodical audits under the supervision of said director, who shall cause such audits to be made. The selectmen, the prudential committee, if any, otherwise the commissioners, or the regional district school committee, may petition said director for an audit of the town or district accounts, as the case may be, when, in their opinion, the condition of the accounts is such as to warrant the making of such audit, and said director, as soon as possible after the receipt of such petition, shall cause such audit to be made.
