        [ Text of section added by 2012, 39, Sec. 3 effective February 22, 2012.]  (a) The registry of motor vehicles shall maintain the donor registry as set forth in section 8D of chapter 90 to identify individuals who have authorized an anatomical gift at the time of issuance of drivers' licenses, identification cards or renewals. The registrar may contract with qualified entities to assist with the continued development and maintenance of the donor registry and to secure grants from public and private sources and to receive and disburse funds which are assigned, donated or bequeathed to the registry of motor vehicles to cover the costs of the donor registry.  (b) A donor registry shall:  (1) provide a database that includes donors who have made anatomical gifts;  (2) provide a mechanism for an anatomical gift to be removed from the database;  (3) be accessible to a procurement organization to allow it to obtain relevant information on the donor registry to determine, at or near the death of the donor or a prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made an anatomical gift; and  (4) be accessible for purposes of clauses (1) to (3), inclusive, 7 days a week on a 24-hour basis.  (c) Personally identifiable information on a donor registry about a donor or prospective donor shall not be used or disclosed without the express consent of the donor, prospective donor or person that made the anatomical gift for any purpose other than to determine, at or near the death of the donor or prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended or revoked an anatomical gift.  (d) This section shall not prohibit a person from creating or maintaining a donor registry that is not established by or under contract with the commonwealth; provided, however, that any such registry shall comply with subsections (b) and (c).
