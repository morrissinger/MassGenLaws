        The board of health of a town may issue to properly qualified persons licenses to engage therein in the business described in section three hundred and three A. Unless otherwise established in a town by town meeting action and in a city by city council action, and in a town with no town meeting by town council action, by adoption of appropriate by-laws and ordinances to set such fees, the fee for such a license shall be one dollar, which shall be paid into the town or city treasury, but in no event shall any such fee be greater than five dollars. The department of public health may issue licenses to such persons to engage in such business anywhere within the commonwealth upon payment of a fee as determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, which shall be paid into the state treasury. All licenses issued under this section shall expire twelve calendar months from the date of issue, and may at any time be suspended or revoked, for cause, by the issuing authority. Such authority shall keep a record of all licenses granted, suspended or revoked by it.
