        If a city council or a town accepts this section or has accepted corresponding provisions of earlier laws, the board of health may require the owner or occupant of an estate which drains into a private drain in a public or private way to put such drain in good repair and condition. If he fails to comply with said order within ten days after notice thereof, he shall be punished by a fine of not more than twenty dollars for every day during which such failure continues.
