        If, during the absence or disability of a commissioner or head of an executive or administrative department or of a director or head of a division in a department, his duties are not specially authorized by law to be performed by another person, the commissioner or head of such department shall designate another person in his department to perform the duties of such person in case of and during such absence or disability, but a person so designated shall have no authority to make permanent appointments or removals. Every such designation shall be subject to approval by the governor, and shall remain in force and effect until revoked by the commissioner or head of such department or by the governor; provided, however, that such designation shall continue after the death of such commissioner or head of department until revoked by his successor.
