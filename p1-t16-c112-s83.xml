Upon payment of a fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, such person shall be examined by the board, and if found to be qualified, shall be registered and given a certificate thereof signed by the chairman and secretary of the board. 
No person shall be registered by the board as a funeral director unless he has been found by the board upon examination to be eighteen years of age or over, a resident of this commonwealth, a citizen of the United States, of good moral character, a duly registered embalmer, unless such person is the surviving spouse of a duly registered and licensed funeral director; to have successfully completed a four-year high school course or has attained the practical equivalent of a high school education; to have satisfactorily completed a course of instruction of not less than nine months in a funeral directing school approved by the board or to have included and successfully completed the elements of such a course of instruction in his study schedule at the college or university which he has attended; to be qualified to prepare such death certificates and other documents as are required by the department of public health for the protection of the general public in the ordinary course of his business; to be familiar with the precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of communicable diseases as prescribed by the department of public health for the protection of the general public welfare; and to be conversant with the laws of the United States and of this commonwealth relative to (a) the custody of dead human bodies; (b) the preparation of such bodies for burial, cremation and shipment, as prescribed by the department of public health for the sanitary handling of dead human bodies by common carriers for the protection of public health; and (c) the cremation, burial and shipment of such bodies as prescribed by the department of public health for sanitary handling of dead human bodies by common carriers for the protection of public health. 
Upon payment of a fee as determined under the aforementioned provision, such person shall be examined by the board. If such person is found to be qualified, such person shall be registered by the board as qualified to be licensed under section forty-nine of chapter one hundred and fourteen as a funeral director, and he shall receive a certificate of registration signed by the chairman and the secretary of the board; provided, that he shall not be so licensed until he furnishes satisfactory proof to the board that he will maintain within the commonwealth a funeral directing establishment so located, constructed and equipped as to permit the sanitary handling of dead human bodies. 
Applicants for registration as embalmers or as funeral directors may, upon the payment of a fee as determined under the aforementioned provision, be re-examined at any subsequent examination conducted by the board.

The application shall state that the applicant is a citizen of the United States, of good moral character, and holds a high school diploma or its equivalent. Said application must be accompanied by a fee as determined under the aforementioned provision.

The board shall issue a certificate for said establishment after application has been made on a form provided for the purpose, and when the same meets the requirements set forth in the rules and regulations of the board and established by the rules and regulations of the department of public health and local boards of health. Said application shall be accompanied by a fee as determined under the aforementioned provision.
