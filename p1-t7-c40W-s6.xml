        [Text of section applicable as provided by 2010, 240, Sec. 199. See 2010, 240, Sec. 195.] 
The corporation shall endeavor to participate in projects each year that provide financial products, which in the aggregate total not less than 20 percent of the total capital committed by the corporation in that year, to minority-owned or women-owned contractors notwithstanding the conditions described in section 5, except that the corporation shall have determined, in writing; (a) that the project plans conform to applicable environmental, zoning, building, planning and sanitation laws; (b) that there is a reasonable expectation that the project will be successful; and (c) that the participation of the corporation is necessary for the successful completion of the proposed project because funding for the project is unavailable in the traditional capital markets, or that credit has been offered on terms that would preclude the success of the project.
