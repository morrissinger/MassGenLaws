    <text>
        If a person at an election refuses to obey the lawful commands of the presiding officer or, by disorderly conduct interrupts or disturbs the proceedings of an election officer, the presiding officer may require any police officer, constable or other person to take him into custody and detain him until after the election; but the presiding officer may at any time order his release. Such order of detention shall not be so enforced as to prevent such person, if a voter at that polling place, from voting.
