        Any buyer who has suffered any injury as a result of a violation of sections seventy-eight to eighty-eight, inclusive, or the attorney general, may bring an action for recovery of damages or other relief, including injunctive relief, multiple damages and attorneyâ€™s fees, as and to the extent provided for under chapter ninety-three A. Nothing in sections seventy-eight to eighty-eight, inclusive, shall be construed so as to nullify or impair any right or rights which a buyer may have against a seller at common law, by statute, or otherwise. The provisions of said sections seventy-eight to eighty-eight, inclusive, are not exclusive and do not relieve the seller or his assignees or the contracts subject to said sections from compliance with all other applicable provisions of law. 
Absent a showing of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct, no cause of action against a health club or its employees may arise in connection with the use or non-use of a defibrillator.
