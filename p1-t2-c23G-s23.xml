        The incubator sponsor shall require tenant businesses to leave the incubator facility within five years. The incubator sponsor, upon determination by the governing board of the incubator facility, may allow a tenant business a limited extension of time beyond the five year period to remain in the incubator. The considerations shall include, but not be limited to, available space in the facility; the achievement of financial viability within the extension period; and the inadequacy or lack of affordable space, with good faith substantiation of an effort to secure reasonable relocation space.
